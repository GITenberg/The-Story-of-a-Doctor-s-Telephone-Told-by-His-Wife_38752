<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_5" title="5"> </a>TO THE READER.</h2>

<p>The telephone has revolutionized the doctor's
life.</p>

<p>In the old days when a horse's galloping hoofs
were heard people looked out of their windows
and wondered if that wasn't someone after a
doctor! The steed that Franklin harnessed bears
the message now, and comments and curiosity
are stilled. In the old days thunderous knocks
came often to the doctor's door at night; they are
never heard now, or so rarely as to need no mention.
Neighbors have been awakened by these
importunate raps: they sleep on undisturbed now.</p>

<p>The doctor's household enjoys nothing of this
sweet immunity. A disturbing factor is within
it that makes the thunderous knocks of old pale
into insignificance.</p>

<p>When the telephone first came into the town
where our doctor lived he had one put in his
office of course, for if anyone in the world needs
a 'phone it is the doctor and the people who want
him. By and by he bethought him that since his
office was several blocks from his residence he
had better put one in there, too, because of calls
that come in the night. So it was promptly installed.
The doctor and his wife found their sleep
disturbed far oftener than before. People will
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>
not dress and go out into the night to the doctor's
house unless it is necessary. But it is an easy
thing to step to the 'phone and call him from his
sleep to answer questions&mdash;often needless&mdash;and
when several people do the same thing in
the same night, as frequently happens, it is not
hard to see what the effect may be.</p>

<p>One day the doctor had an idea! He would
connect the two 'phones. It would be a handy
thing for Mary to be able to talk to him about
the numberless little things that come up in a
household without the trouble of ringing central
every time, and it would be a handy thing
for him, too. When he had to leave the office
he could just 'phone Mary and she could keep
an ear on the 'phone till he got back.</p>

<p>About this time another telephone system was
established in the town&mdash;the Farmers'. Now
a doctor's clientele includes many farmers, so he
put one of the new 'phones into his office. By
and by he reflected that farmers are apt to need
to consult a physician at night&mdash;he must put
in a Farmers' 'phone at home, too. And he did.
Then he connected it with the office.</p>

<p>When the first 'phone went up Mary soon accustomed
herself to its call&mdash;three rings. When
her husband connected it with the office the rings
were multiplied by three. One ring meant someone
at the office calling central. Two rings meant
someone calling the office. Three rings meant
someone calling the residence, as before. Mary
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a>
found the three calls confusing. When the
Farmers' 'phone was installed and the same order
of rings set up, she found the original ring
multiplied by six. This was confusion worse
confounded. To be sure the bell on the Farmers'
had a somewhat hoarser sound than that on the
Citizens' 'phone, but Mary's ear was the only
one in the household that could tell the difference
with certainty. The clock in the same room
struck the half hours which did not tend to simplify
matters. When a new door-bell was put
on the front door Mary found she had eight different
rings to contend with. But it is the bells
of the Telephone with which we are concerned
and something of their story will unfold as we
proceed.</p>

<p>When the doctor was at home and the 'phone
would ring he would start toward the adjoining
room where the two hung and stop at the first.</p>

<p>Mary would call &ldquo;Farmers'!&rdquo; and he would
move on to the next. Perhaps at the same instant
the tall boy of the household whose ear was
no more accurate than that of his father would
shout &ldquo;Citizens'!&rdquo; and the doctor would stop
between the two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Farmers'!</em>&rdquo; the wife would call a second time,
with accrued emphasis. Then she would laugh
heartily and declare:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any one coming in might think this a sort
of forum where orations were being delivered,&rdquo;
and sometimes she would go on and declaim:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>&ldquo;Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your
ears&mdash;my husband has borrowed mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the telephone in the doctor's house&mdash;so
great a necessity that we cannot conceive of life
without it, so great a blessing that we are hourly
grateful for it, is yet a very great tyrant whose
dominion is absolute.</p>

<p>I had a pleasing picture in my mind in the
writing of this chronicle, of sitting serene and undisturbed
in a cosy den upstairs, with all the
doors between me and the 'phone shut tight
where no sound might intrude. In vain. Without
climbing to the attic I could not get so far
away that the tintinnabulation that so mercilessly
wells from those bells, bells, bells did not
penetrate.</p>

<p>I hope my readers have not got so far away
from their Poe as to imagine that ringing sentence
to be mine. And I wonder if a still greater
glory might not crown his brow if there had
been telephone bells to celebrate in Poe's day.</p>

<p>So I gave up the pleasant dream, abandoned
the cosy den and came down stairs to the dining
room where I can scatter my manuscript about
on the big table, and look the tyrants in the face
and answer the queries that arise, and can sandwich
in a good many little odd jobs besides.</p>

<p>Through a doctor's telephone how many
glimpses of human nature and how many peeps
into the great Story of Life have been mine; and
if, while the reader is peeping too, the scene suddenly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" title="9"> </a>
closes, why that is the way of telephones
and not the fault of the writer.</p>

<p>And knowing how restful a thing it has been
to me to get away from the ringing of the bell
at times, I have devised a rest for the reader also
and have sent him with the doctor and his wife
on an occasional country drive where no telephone
intrudes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p>The hands of the clock were climbing around
toward eleven and the doctor had not returned.
Mary, a drowsiness beginning to steal over her,
looked up with a yawn. Then she fell into a soliloquy:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">To bed, or not to bed&mdash;that is the question:<br/></div>
<div class="line">Whether 'tis wiser in the wife to wait for a belated spouse,<br/></div>
<div class="line">Or to wrap the drapery of her couch about her<br/></div>
<div class="line">And lie down to pleasant dreams?<br/></div>
<div class="line">To dream! perchance to sleep!<br/></div>
<div class="line">And by that sleep to end the headache<br/></div>
<div class="line">And the thousand other ills that flesh is heir to,<br/></div>
<div class="line">The restoration of a wilted frame,&mdash;<br/></div>
<div class="line">Wilted by loss of sleep on previous nights&mdash;<br/></div>
<div class="line">A consummation devoutly to be wished.<br/></div>
<div class="line">To dream! perchance to sleep!&mdash;aye, there's the rub;<br/></div>
<div class="line">For in that somnolence what peals may come<br/></div>
<div class="line">Must give her pause. There is the telephone<br/></div>
<div class="line">That makes calamity of her repose.<br/></div>
<div class="line">Her spouse may not have come to answer it,<br/></div>
<div class="line">Which means that she, his wife, must issue forth<br/></div>
<div class="line">All dazed and breathless from delicious sleep,<br/></div>
<div class="line">And knock her knees on intervening chairs,<br/></div>
<div class="line">And bump her head on a half open door,<br/></div>
<div class="line">And get there finally all out of breath,<br/></div>
<div class="line">And take the receiver down and say: &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;<br/></div>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" title="12"> </a><div class="line">The old, old question: &ldquo;Is the doctor there?&rdquo;<br/></div>
<div class="line">Comes clearly now to her awakened ear.<br/></div>
<div class="line">Then, tentatively, she must make reply:<br/></div>
<div class="line">&ldquo;The doctor was called out an hour ago,<br/></div>
<div class="line">But I expect him now at any time.&rdquo;<br/></div>
<div class="line">Good patrons should be held and not escape<br/></div>
<div class="line">To other doctors that may lie in wait;<br/></div>
<div class="line">For in this voice so brusque and straight and clear<br/></div>
<div class="line">She recognizes an old friend and true,<br/></div>
<div class="line">Whose purse is ever ready to make good,<br/></div>
<div class="line">And she hath need of many, many things.<br/></div>
<div class="line">But then, again, the message of the 'phone<br/></div>
<div class="line">May be that of some stricken little child<br/></div>
<div class="line">Whose mother's voice trembles with love and fear.<br/></div>
<div class="line">Then must the listener earnestly advise:<br/></div>
<div class="line">&ldquo;Don't wait for him! Get someone else to-night.&rdquo;<br/></div>
<div class="line">Perchance again the message may be that<br/></div>
<div class="line">Of colics dire and death so imminent<br/></div>
<div class="line">That she who listens, tho' with 'customed ear,<br/></div>
<div class="line">Shrinks back dismayed and knows not what to say,<br/></div>
<div class="line">Lacking the knowledge and profanity<br/></div>
<div class="line">Of him who, were he there, would settle quick<br/></div>
<div class="line">This much ado about much nothingness.<br/></div>
<div class="line">And so these anticipatory peals<br/></div>
<div class="line">Reverberate through fancy as she sits,<br/></div>
<div class="line">And make her rather choose to bear the ills<br/></div>
<div class="line">She has than fly to others she may meet;<br/></div>
<div class="line">To wait a little longer for her spouse,<br/></div>
<div class="line">That, when at last she does retire to rest,<br/></div>
<div class="line">She may be somewhat surer of her sleep.<br/></div>
<div class="line">And so she sits there waiting for the step<br/></div>
<div class="line">And the accompanying clearing of the throat<br/></div>
<div class="line">Which she would know were she in Zanzibar.<br/></div>
<div class="line">And by-and-by he comes and fate is kind<br/></div>
<div class="line">And lets them slumber till the early dawn.<br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" title="13"> </a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p>Ten P.M. The 'phone is ringing and the
sleepy doctor gets out of bed and goes to answer
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Doctor Blank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to come out to my house&mdash;my
wife's sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim Warner. Come just as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A click in the receiver.</p>

<p>The doctor waits a minute. Then he says
&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo; No answer. He waits another minute.
&ldquo;<em>Hell-o!!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence. &ldquo;Damn that girl&mdash;she's cut us off.&rdquo;
He hangs up the receiver and rings the bell
sharply. He takes it down and hears a
voice say leisurely, &ldquo;D'ye get them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! What in h-ll did you cut us off for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute&mdash;I'll ring 'em again,&rdquo; says
the voice, hasty and obliging, so potent a thing is
a man's unveiled wrath. She rings 'em again.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" title="14"> </a>
Soon the same voice says, &ldquo;Are you there yet,
Doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, <em>now</em> what is it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice proceeds and the doctor listens putting
in an occasional &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then he
says, &ldquo;All right&mdash;I'll be out there in a little bit.&rdquo;
He hangs up the receiver and his wife falls
asleep again. The doctor dresses and goes out.
The house is in darkness. All is still. In about
five minutes Mary is suddenly, sharply awake.
A slight noise in the adjoining room! She listens
with accelerated heart-beats. The doctor
has failed to put on the night latch. Some thief
has been lying in wait watching for his opportunity,
and now he has entered. What can she
do. Muffled footsteps! she pulls the sheet over
her head, her heart beating to suffocation. The
footsteps grope their way toward her room!
Great Heaven! A hand fumbles at the door
knob. She shrieks aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth is the matter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>O, brusque and blessed is that voice!</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, you have nearly scared me to death,&rdquo;
she says, sitting up in bed, half laughing and
half crying. &ldquo;But I heard you tell that man you
were coming out there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I told him I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why didn't you go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>did</em> go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't mean to tell me you have been a
mile and back in five minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>The doctor flashed on the light and looked at
his watch,&mdash;&ldquo;Just an hour since I left home,&rdquo;
he said. Mary gasped. &ldquo;Well, it only proves
how soundly I can sleep when I get a chance,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>It is the office ring but Mary hurries at once
to answer it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank's office?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mrs. Blank. But the doctor telephoned
me about twenty minutes ago that he
would be out for half an hour. Call him again in
ten or fifteen minutes and I think you will find
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In about fifteen minutes the call is repeated.
Mary would feel better satisfied to know that the
doctor received the message so she goes to the
'phone and listens. Silence. She waits a minute.
Shall she speak? She hesitates. Struggle
as she will against the feeling, she can't quite
overcome it&mdash;it seems like &ldquo;butting in.&rdquo; But
that long silence with the listening ear at the
other end of it is too much for her. Very
pleasantly, almost apologetically she asks, &ldquo;What
is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctor hasn't come yet?&rdquo; says a plainly
disappointed voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not yet. There are often unexpected
things to delay him&mdash;if you will give me your
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a>
number or your name I will have him call <em>you</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I'll just wait and call him again.&rdquo; The
inflection says plainly, &ldquo;I don't care to admit the
doctor's wife into my confidences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. I am sure it can't be long now
till he returns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary goes back to her chair and ponders a
little. Of what avail to multiply words. No use
to tell the woman 'phoning that she was willing
to take the waiting and the watching, the seeing
that the doctor received the message upon herself
rather than that the other should be again
troubled by it. No use to let her gently understand
that she doesn't care for any confidences
which belong only to her husband, but Fate has
placed her in a position where she has oftentimes
to seem unduly interested. That these messages
which are only occasional with the one calling
are constant with her and that she is only mindful
of them when she must be.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>&ldquo;Watch the 'phone.&rdquo; How thoroughly instilled
into Mary's consciousness that admonition
was! She did not heed the office ring when it
came, but if it came a second time she always
went to explain that the doctor had just stepped
over to the drug store probably and would be
back in a very few minutes. Often, as she stood
explaining, the doctor himself would break into
the conversation, having been in another room
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17"> </a>
when the first call came, and getting there a
little tardily for the second. But occasions sometimes
arose which made Mary feel very thankful
that she had been at the 'phone. One winter
morning as she stood explaining to some woman
that the doctor would be in in a few minutes, her
husband's &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; was heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he is now,&rdquo; she said. Usually after
this announcement she would hang up the receiver
and go about her work. Today a friendly
interest in this pleasant voice kept it in her hand
a moment. Mary would not have admitted idle
curiosity, and perhaps she had as little of it as
falls to the lot of women, but sometimes she lingered
a moment for the message, to know if the
doctor was to be called away, so that she might
make her plans for dinner accordingly. The
pleasant voice spoke again, &ldquo;This is Dr. Blank,
is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want you to come out to Henry Ogden's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's about five miles out, isn't it. <ins title="Whose">Who's</ins>
sick out there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Ogden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long has she been sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She began complaining last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;I'll be out some time today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come right away, please, if you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is an old, old plea. The doctor is thoroughly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>
inured to it. He would have to be twenty
men instead of one to respond to it at all times.
He answers cheerfully, &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and Mary
takes alarm. That tone means sometime in the
next few hours. She feels sure he ought to go
<em>now</em>. Somebody else can wait better than this
patient. There was a kind of hesitancy in that
voice that Mary had heard before. A woman's
intuitions are much safer guides than a man's
slow reasoning. She must speak to John. She
rings the office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, John,&rdquo; she says in a low voice, &ldquo;I came
to the 'phone thinking you were out and heard
that message. I think you ought to go out there
right <em>away</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I'm going after a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don't think you ought to wait. I'm
sure it's&mdash;<em>you</em> know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&mdash;maybe I had better go right out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would. I know they'll be looking
for you every minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mary saw him drive past
and was glad. Half an hour later the office ring
sounded. She did not wait for the second peal.
True, John had not said, &ldquo;Watch the 'phone,&rdquo;
today, but that was understood. Occasionally
he got an old man who lived next door to the
office to come in and stay during his absence.
Possibly he might have done so today. But even
if he were there the telephone and its ways were
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>
a dark mystery to him and besides, his deafness
made him of little use in that direction.</p>

<p>Mary took down the receiver and put it to
her ear. A lady's voice was asking, &ldquo;Who <em>is</em>
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary knew from her inflection that she had
asked something before and was not satisfied
with the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>This</em> is Dr. Blank's office?&rdquo; announced the old
man in a sort of interrogative.</p>

<p><ins title="Well">&ldquo;Well</ins>, where is the <em>doctor</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctor,&rdquo; said the old man meditatively,
as if wondering that anybody should be calling
for him&mdash;&ldquo;the doctor&mdash;you mean Dr. Blank,
I reckon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens,&rdquo; thought Mary, &ldquo;why <em>don't</em>
he go on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he's out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where <em>is</em> he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He went to the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary shut her lips tight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Well</em>, when will he be back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He 'lowed he'd be back in about an hour
or so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long has he been <em>gone</em>? Maybe I'll get
some information after a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary longed to speak. Why hadn't she done
so at first. If she thrust herself in now it would
make her out an eavesdropper. But this was unbearable.
She opened her mouth to speak when
the old man answered.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>&ldquo;He's been gone over an hour now, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he'll soon be back. Will you be there
when he comes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes ma'am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then tell him to come up to Mrs. Dorlan's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Mrs. Who's?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. <em>Dorlan's</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't ketch the name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mrs. Dorlan's</em>, on Brownson street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Torren's?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;MISS-ES&mdash;DOR-LAN'S!&rdquo; shouted the
voice.</p>

<p>Mary sighed fiercely and clinched her teeth
unconsciously. &ldquo;I <em>will</em> speak,&rdquo; she thought, when
the old voice ventured doubtingly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Dorlan's?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's it. Mrs. Dorlan's on Brownson street,
will you remember it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Dorlan's, on Brownson street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's right. Please tell him just as soon as
he comes to come right up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;I'll tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old fellow!&rdquo; said Mary as she turned
from the 'phone, &ldquo;but I don't want to go through
any more ordeals like that. It was a good deal
harder for me than for the other woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor came down late to dinner. &ldquo;You
got Mrs. Dorlan's message did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I'll go up there right after dinner.&rdquo; He
looked at his wife with peculiar admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know what was wanted with me
out in the country?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21"> </a>With a little pardonable pride she replied: &ldquo;Oh,
I just felt it. Women have ways of understanding
each other that men never attain to. Is it
a boy or a girl added to the world today?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; said the doctor placidly, helping
himself to a roll.</p>

<p>Chagrin overspread her face. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said
with an embarrassed smile, &ldquo;I erred on mercy's
side, and it <em>might</em> have happened in just that
way, John, and you know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor laughed. &ldquo;There was mighty little
the matter out there&mdash;they didn't need a doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they good pay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good as old wheat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there are compensations.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Some hours later when the 'phone rang, Mary
went to explain that the doctor had 'phoned her
he would be out about twenty minutes. But she
found no chance to speak. A spirited dialogue
was taking place between a young man and a
maid:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where <em>are</em> you, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm right here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smarty! Where <em>are</em> you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Dr. Blank's office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you there for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm waiting for the doctor and to while away
the time thought I'd call you up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then it was his ring that Mary had answered.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>
&ldquo;I ought to hang this receiver right up,&rdquo; thought
she, but instead she held it, her face beaming with
a sympathetic smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you feeling better today, Dolly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I'm better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Able to go to the show then, tonight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Yes</em>, I'm able to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here a thin small voice put in, &ldquo;No, you're not
able! You're not going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma says,&mdash;&rdquo; began a pouting voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard what she said,&rdquo; said Jack, laughing.
&ldquo;Have you been up all day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you eat anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ate an egg, some toast and some fruit for
dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's fine. I'll bring you a box of candy
then pretty soon&mdash;I'm coming down in a little
bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be lovely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which, the candy or the coming down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The candy, goose, of course.&rdquo; A laugh at
both ends of the wire.</p>

<p>Then Jack's voice. &ldquo;Well, here comes the
doctor. I've got to have my neck amputated now.
Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All's fair in love and war,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;and
it's plain to see what this is.&rdquo; Then she hung
up the receiver without a qualm.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" title="23"> </a>There were other times when the doctor's wife
was glad she had gone to the 'phone, as in this
instance.</p>

<p>She had taken down the receiver when a man's
voice said, &ldquo;The doctor just stepped out for a
few minutes. If you will tell me your name,
madam, I'll have him call you when he comes
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Disinterested courtesy spoke in his voice, but
Mary was not in the least surprised to hear the
curt reply, &ldquo;It won't be necessary. I'll call <em>him</em>
when he comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say that gentleman, whoever he may
be, is wondering what he has done,&rdquo; thought
Mary.</p>

<p>But it was not altogether unpleasant to her to
hear somebody else squelched, too!</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>There came a day when the doctor's wife rebelled.
When her husband came home and ate
his supper hastily and then rose to depart, she
said, &ldquo;You'd better wait at home a few minutes,
John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; He put the question brusquely, his
hat in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I think someone will ring here for
you in a minute or two. Some man rang the
office twice so I went to the 'phone to explain that
you must be on your way to supper and he could
find you here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" title="24"> </a>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thunder! Why didn't you find out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary looked straight at her husband. &ldquo;How
many times have I told you, John, that many people
decline to give their names or their messages
to any one but you. I think I should feel that
way about it myself. For a long time I have
dutifully done your bidding in the matter, but
now I vow I will not trample my pride under
my feet any longer&mdash;especially when it is all in
vain. I will watch the 'phone as faithfully as in
the past, but I will not ask for any name or any
message. They will be given voluntarily if at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Mary,&rdquo; said the doctor, gently, seeing
that she was quite serious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not mean to say that most of the people
who 'phone are grouchy and disagreeable&mdash;far
from it. Indeed the majority are pleasant and
courteous. But it is those who are not who have
routed me, and made me vow my vow. Don't
ask me to break it, John, for I will not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And having delivered this declaration, Mary
felt almost as free and independent as in ante-telephone
days.</p>

<p>The doctor had seated himself and leaning
forward was swinging his hat restlessly between
his knees. He waited five minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll have to get back to the office,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
starting up. &ldquo;I'm expecting a man
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" title="25"> </a>
to pay me some money. Waiting for the
'phone to ring is like watching for the pot to
boil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he had been gone a minute or two, the
ring came. With a new step Mary advanced to
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has the doctor got there yet?&rdquo; the voice had
lost none of its grouch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has. And he waited for your message
which did not come. He could not wait longer.
He has just gone to the office. If you will 'phone
him there in two or three minutes, instead of
waiting till he is called out again, you will find
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Blank.&rdquo; The man was surprised
into courtesy.</p>

<p>The clear-cut, distinct sentences were very different
from the faltering, apologetic ones, when
she had asked for his name or his message
twenty minutes before.</p>

<p>Mary's receiver clicked with no uncertain
sound and a smile illumined her face.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>One day when the snow was flying and the
wind was blowing a gale the doctor came hurrying
in. &ldquo;Where is the soapstone?&rdquo; he asked,
with small amenity. His wife flew to get it and
laid it on the hearth very close to the coals. &ldquo;Oh
dear! How terrible to go out in such a storm.
Do you <em>have</em> to?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" title="26"> </a>&ldquo;I certainly do. Do you think I'd choose a
day like this for a pleasure trip?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren't you glad you got that galloway?&rdquo; she
asked, hurrying to bring the big, hairy garment
from its hook in the closet. She helped her husband
into it, turned the broad collar up&mdash;then,
when the soapstone was hot, she wrapped it up
and gave it to him. &ldquo;This ought to keep your
feet from freezing,&rdquo; she said. The doctor took
it, hurried out to the buggy, pulled the robes up
around him and was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight miles in this blizzard!&rdquo; thought Mary
shivering, &ldquo;and eight miles back&mdash;sixteen miles.
It will take most of the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two hours after the doctor had gone the telephone
rang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Dr. Blank there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he is in the country, about eight miles
southwest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Drayton. We want him at John
Small's as soon as possible. How soon do you
think he will be back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for several hours, I am afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, will you send him down as soon as he
comes? We want him <em>bad</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary assured him she would do so. &ldquo;Poor
John,&rdquo; she thought as she put up the receiver.</p>

<p>In a few minutes she went hurriedly back.
When she had called central, she said, &ldquo;I am
very anxious to get Dr. Blank, central. He is
eight miles southwest of here&mdash;at the home of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" title="27"> </a>
Thomas Calhoun. Is there a 'phone there?&rdquo;
Silence for a few seconds then a voice, &ldquo;No, there
is no 'phone at Thomas Calhoun's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Disappointed, Mary stood irresolute, thinking.
Then she asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there a 'phone at Mr. William Huntley's?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, William Huntley has a 'phone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you. Please call that house for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a minute a man's voice said, &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Mr. Huntley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Huntley, this is Mrs. Blank. You live
not far from Thomas Calhoun's, do you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About half a mile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Blank is there, or will be very soon, and
there is an urgent call for him to go on to Drayton.
I want to save him the long drive home
first. I find there is no 'phone at Mr. Calhoun's
so I have called you hoping you might be able
to help me out. Perhaps someone of your family
will be going down that way and will stop in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll go, myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's too bad to ask any one to go out on a
day like this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's all right, Mrs. Blank. Doc's been
pretty clever to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him, please, to go to John Small's at
Drayton. I am very deeply obliged to you for
your kindness, Mr. Huntley,&rdquo; she said, hanging
the receiver in its place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight miles back home, six miles from here
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>
to Drayton, six miles back&mdash;twenty miles in
all. Four miles from Calhoun's to Drayton, six
miles from Drayton home&mdash;ten miles saved on
a blizzardy day,&rdquo; she thought in the thankfulness
of her heart.</p>

<p>A few minutes later she was again at the
'phone. &ldquo;Please give me John Small's at <ins title="Drayton.">Drayton.&rdquo;</ins>
When the voice came she said, &ldquo;I wanted
to tell you that the doctor will be there perhaps
in about an hour now. I got your message to
him so that he will go directly to your house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm mighty glad to know it. Thank you, Mrs.
Blank, for finding him and for letting us know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A terrible drive saved and some anxious hearts
relieved. That dear 'phone! How thankful she
was for it and for the country drives she had
taken with her husband which had made her familiar
with the homes and names of many farmers.
Otherwise she could not have located her
husband this morning. One day like this covered
a multitude of tyrannies from the little instrument
on the wall.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>It was about half past seven. The doctor had
thought it probable that he could get off early
this evening and then he and Mary and the boys
would have a game of whist. He had been
called in consultation to W., a little town in an
adjoining county, but he would be home in a
little bit&mdash;in just ten minutes the train would be
due.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29"> </a>&ldquo;O, there goes that 'phone,&rdquo; said the small boy
wrathfully. &ldquo;Now, I s'pose papa can't get
here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His mother was already there with the receiver
at her ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Dr. Blank's residence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but he will be here in fifteen or twenty
minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Drayton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. I will give him your message as
soon as he gets home. I'm afraid that ends the
game for tonight, boys,&rdquo; putting the receiver up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, does papa have to go away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has to drive six miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee-mi-nee&mdash;this dark night in the mud!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here a thought flashed into Mary's mind&mdash;Drayton
was on the same railroad on which
the doctor was rapidly nearing home&mdash;the next
station beyond. She flew to the telephone and
rang with nervous haste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the Big Four?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mrs. Blank. Dr. Blank is on the
train which is due now. He is wanted at Drayton.
When he gets off, will you please tell
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To go on to Drayton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, to Alfred Walton's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. I'll watch for him and see that he
gets aboard again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30"> </a>&ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The train whistled. &ldquo;Just in time,&rdquo; said Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how'll papa get back?&rdquo; asked the smaller
boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's got a tie-ticket,&rdquo; said his brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa would rather walk back on the
railroad than drive both ways through this deep
mud,&rdquo; said their mother. &ldquo;I have heard him
say so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the doctor there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has just gone on the train to Drayton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How soon will he be back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In an hour and a half, I should think.&rdquo;</p>

<p><ins title="&ldquo;Mary">Mary</ins> heard the 'phoner say in an aside, &ldquo;He
won't be back for an hour and a half. Do you
want to wait that long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another voice replied, &ldquo;Yes, I'll wait. Tell
'em to tell him to come just as quick as he gets
back, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This message was transmitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where is he to go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Henry Smith's, down by the Big Four
depot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mary had another idea.
She went to the 'phone and asked central to
give her Drayton, Mr. Walton's <ins title="house.&rdquo;">house.</ins></p>

<p>In a minute a voice said, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; It
was restful to Mary to have the usual opening
varied. Perhaps eight out of ten began with,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; The other two began, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; and very rarely, &ldquo;Good
morning,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Good evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the home of Mr. Walton at Drayton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Blank is there just now, isn't he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he's just going away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please ask him to come to the
'phone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a minute her husband's voice was heard
asking what was wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to save you a long walk when you get
home, John. You're wanted at Henry Smith's
down by the Big Four depot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. I'll go in to see him when I get
there. Much obliged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mile walk saved there,&rdquo; mused the doctor's
wife, as she joined the two boys, mildly grumbling
because they couldn't have their game, and
never could have it just when they wanted it. But
a few chapters from Ivanhoe read to them by
their mother made all serene again.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>The Citizens' 'phone was ringing persistently.
The doctor's wife had been upstairs and could
not get to it in less than no time! But she got
there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know where Dr. Blank is?&rdquo; the words
hurled themselves against her ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know just at this minute&mdash;but he's
here in town. I'm sure of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" title="32"> </a>&ldquo;Why don't he <em>come</em> then!&rdquo; The sentence
came as from a catapult.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know anything about it. Where was
he to go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A scornful &ldquo;<em>Huh!</em>&rdquo; came over the wire&mdash;&ldquo;I
guess you forgot to tell 'im.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not been asked to tell him anything
this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was heated silence for an instant, then
a voice big with wrath:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You told me not fifteen minutes ago that you
would send him right down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said Mary gently but
firmly. &ldquo;This is the first time I have been at the
'phone this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of that!&rdquo; This was
addressed to someone at the other end of the
line, but it came clearly to Mary's ear and its
intonation said volumes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're the very identical woman that told me
when I 'phoned awhile ago that you'd send him
right down. It's the very same voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a mistake somewhere,&rdquo; reiterated
Mary, patiently, &ldquo;but I'll send the doctor as soon
as he gets in if you will give me your name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll tell ye agin, then, that he's to come to
Lige Thornton's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. I'll send him,&rdquo; and Mary left the
'phone much mystified. &ldquo;She was in dead earnest&mdash;and
so was I. I can't understand it.&rdquo;
Glancing out of the window she saw her tall,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"> </a>
young daughter coming up the walk. The solution
came with lightning quickness&mdash;strange
she didn't think of that, Gertrude had answered.
She remembered now that others had thought
their voices very much alike, especially over the
'phone. &ldquo;If the woman had not talked in such
a cyclonic way I would have thought of it,&rdquo; she
reflected.</p>

<p>When the young girl entered the room her
mother said, &ldquo;Gertrude, you answered the 'phone
awhile ago, didn't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About twenty minutes ago. Some woman
was so anxious for father to come right away
that I just ran down to the office to see that he
<em>went</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was very thoughtful of you, dear, but
it's little credit we're getting for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She related the dialogue that had just taken
place and mother and daughter laughed in sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mamma, we couldn't forget if we
wanted to. That telephone is an Old Man of the
Sea to both of us&mdash;is now and ever shall be,
world without end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But did you find your father at the office?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and waited till he fixed up some medicine
for two patients already waiting, then shooed
him out before some more came in. I wanted
to get it off <em>my</em> mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm glad he is on his way. Now stay within
hearing of the 'phone, dearie, till I finish my
work up-stairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" title="34"> </a>&ldquo;All right, Mamma, I'm going to make a cake
now, but I can hear the 'phone plainly from the
kitchen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It wasn't long till a ring was heard. Gertrude
dusted the flour from her hands and started.
&ldquo;Which 'phone was it?&rdquo; she asked the maid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it was the Farmers',&rdquo; said Mollie, hesitating.</p>

<p>So to the Farmers' 'phone went Gertrude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>She clapped the receiver up and hurried to
the Citizens' 'phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank's?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he was called&mdash;&rdquo; Here a loud ring from
the other 'phone sounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was called down to&mdash;&rdquo; said Gertrude rapidly,
then paused, unable to think of the name
at the instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will tell me where he went, I'll just
'phone down there for him,&rdquo; said the voice.</p>

<p>A second peal from the other 'phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Yes, yes!</em>&rdquo; said Gertrude impatiently. &ldquo;O,
I didn't mean that for you,&rdquo; she hurried apologetically.
&ldquo;The other 'phone is calling, and I'm
so confused I can't think. Will you excuse me
just an instant till I see what is wanted?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35"> </a>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flew to the Farmers' <ins title="phone">'phone</ins>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank's?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good while a-answerin',&rdquo; grumbled a voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did answer but no one answered <em>me</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's the doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's down in the east part of town&mdash;will
be back in a little bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, when he comes tell him&mdash;just hold the
'phone a minute, will you, till I speak to my
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; But she put the receiver swiftly
up and rushed back to the waiting man. She
could answer him and get back by the time the
other was ready for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, still there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've thought of the name&mdash;father went to
Elijah Thornton's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thornton's&mdash;let's see&mdash;have you a telephone
directory handy&mdash;could you give me
their number?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, I'll see.&rdquo; She raced through
the pages,&mdash;<ins title="yes">&ldquo;yes</ins>, here it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A violent peal from the Farmers' 'phone.
&ldquo;He'll think I'm still hunting for the number,&rdquo;
she thought, letting the receiver hang and rushing
to the other 'phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thought you was a-goin' to hold <ins title="the' phone">the 'phone</ins>.
I've had a turrible time gittin' any answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>&ldquo;I've had a turrible time, too,&rdquo; thought poor
Gertrude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell the doctor to call me up,&rdquo; and he gave
his name and his number.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I'll tell him.&rdquo; She clapped the receiver
up lest there might be more to follow and
sped back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; she announced calmly, &ldquo;Elijah
Thornton, number&nbsp;101.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I'm afraid I've put you to a good
deal of trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she went back to her cake she said to herself,
&ldquo;Two telephones ringing at once can certainly
make things interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>One day in mid winter Mary sat half dreaming
before the glowing coals. Snow had fallen all
through the previous night and today there had
been good coasting for the boys and girls.</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.
Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>She started up and went to answer it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this you, Mary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll be out of the office about twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes Mary wished her husband would be
a little more explicit. She had a vague sort of
feeling that central, or whoever should chance
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_37" title="37"> </a>
to hear him make this announcement to her so
often, might think she requested or perhaps demanded
it; might think she wanted to know
every place her husband went.</p>

<p>In about half an hour the 'phone rang again,
two rings.</p>

<p>John ought to be back. Should she
take it for granted? It would be safer to put the
receiver to her ear and listen for her husband's
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this you Dr. Blank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want ye to come down to our house right
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;W'y, this is Mrs. Peters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Peters? Oh yes,&rdquo; said the doctor, recognizing
the voice now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's the matter down there, grandmother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;W'y&mdash;my little grandson, Johnny, was slidin'
down hill on a board and got a splinter in his
setter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did, and a big one, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I'll be down there right away. Have
some boiled water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary turned away from the telephone that it
might not register her low laughter as she put the
receiver in its place. The next instant she took
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" title="38"> </a>
it down again with twinkling eyes and listened.
Yes, the voices were silent, it would be safe. She
rang two rings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said her husband's voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; said Mary, almost in a whisper, &ldquo;for
English free and unadorned, commend me to a
little boy's grandmother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two laughs met over the wire, then two receivers
clicked.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>One day Mary came in from a walk and noticed
at once, a vacant place on the wall where
the Farmers' 'phone had hung. She had heard
rumors of a merger of the two systems and had
fervently hoped that they might merge soon and
forever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look! Mamma,&rdquo; said Gertrude, pointing to
the wall.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&ldquo;Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!<br/></div>
<div class="line">One telephone is taken away!&rdquo;<br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">she chortled in her joy.</p>

<p>(The small boy of the household had been
reading &ldquo;Alice&rdquo; and consequently declaiming the
Jabberwock from morning till night, till its weird
strains had become fixed in the various minds of
the household and notably in Gertrude's.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will simplify matters,&rdquo; said her mother,
smiling, &ldquo;but liberty is not for us. <em>That</em> tuneful
peal will still ring on,&rdquo; and as she looked at the
Citizens' 'phone the peal came.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" title="39"> </a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p>One Monday evening the doctor and his wife
sat chatting cosily before the fire. In the midst
of their conversation, Mary looked up suddenly.
&ldquo;I had a queer little experience this morning,
John, I want to tell you about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell ahead,&rdquo; said John, propping his slippered
feet up on the fender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I got my pen and paper ready to write
a letter to Mrs. E. I wanted to write it yesterday
afternoon and tell her some little household
incidents just while they were taking place, as
she is fond of the doings and sayings of boys and
they are more realistic if reported in the present
tense. But I couldn't get at it yesterday afternoon.
When I started to write it this morning it
occurred to me to date the letter Sunday afternoon
and write it just as I would have done yesterday&mdash;so
I did. When I had got it half done
or more I heard the door-bell and going to open
it I saw through the large glass&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>The doctor went to the 'phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll be right down.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" title="40"> </a>He went back, hastily removed his slippers and
began putting on his shoes. Mary saw that he
had clean forgotten her story. Very well. It
wouldn't take more than a minute to finish it&mdash;there
would be plenty of time while he was getting
into his shoes&mdash;but if he was not enough
interested to refer to it again she certainly would
not. In a few minutes the doctor was gone and
Mary went to bed. An hour or two later his
voice broke in upon her slumber. &ldquo;Back again,&rdquo;
he said as he settled down upon his pillow. In
a minute he exclaimed, &ldquo;Say, Mary, what was
the rest of that story?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, don't get me roused up. I'm <em>so</em> sleepy,&rdquo;
she said drowsily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I'd like to hear it.&rdquo; The interest in her
little story which had not been exhibited at the
proper time was being exhibited now with a
vengeance. She sighed and said, &ldquo;I can't think
of it now&mdash;tell you in the morning. Good
night,&rdquo; and turned away.</p>

<p>When morning came and they were both awake,
the doctor again referred to the unfinished story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's lost interest for me. It wasn't a story to
start with, just a little incident that seemed
odd&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let's have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;I was writing away
when the door-bell rang. I went to open it and
saw through the glass the laundry man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" title="41"> </a>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.
Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; exclaimed her husband, hurriedly,
&ldquo;I'll wait till you finish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll not <em>race</em> through a story in any such John
Gilpin style,&rdquo; said Mary, tartly. &ldquo;Go, John!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor arose and went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she any fever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I'll be down in a little bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he went back. &ldquo;Now you can finish,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finis is written <em>here</em>,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;Don't
say story to me again!&rdquo; So Mary's story remained
unfinished.</p>

<p>But a few days later, when she was in the
buggy with her husband she relented. &ldquo;Now
that the 'phone can't cut me short, John, I will
finish about the odd incident just because you
wanted to know. But it will fall pretty flat now,
as all things do with too many preliminary
flourishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know I told you I dated my letter
back to Sunday afternoon, and was writing away
when I heard the door-bell ring. As I started
toward the door I saw the laundry man standing
there. I was conscious of looking at him in
astonishment and in a dazed sort of way as I
walked across the large room to open the door.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_42" title="42"> </a>
I am sure he must have noticed the expression
on my face. When I opened the door he asked
as he always does, &lsquo;Any laundry?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Any laundry <em>today</em>?&rsquo; The words were on
my tongue's end but I stopped them in time.
You see it was really Sunday to me, so deep into
the spirit of it had I got, and it was with a
little shock that I came back to Monday again
in time to answer the man in a rational way.
And now my story's done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bad one, either,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;I'm glad
you condescended to finish it.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>The doctor came home at ten o'clock and went
straight to bed and to sleep. At eleven he was
called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked gruffly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's time for Silas to take his medicine and
he won't do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won't, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he vows he won't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let him alone for a while and then try
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About one came another ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We've both been asleep, Doctor, but I've been
up fifteen minutes trying to get him to take his
medicine and he won't do it. He says it's too
damned nasty and that he don't need it anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him I say he's a mighty good farmer,
but a devilish poor doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" title="43"> </a>&ldquo;I don't know what to do. I can't make him
take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'll have to let him alone for awhile I
guess, maybe he'll change his mind after awhile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At three o'clock the doctor was again at the
telephone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, he just will <em>not</em> take it,&rdquo; the voice was
now quite distressed. &ldquo;I can't manage him at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>ought</em> to manage him. What's a wife
for? Well, go to bed and don't bother him or
me any more tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But early next morning Silas' wife telephoned
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I ought to tell you that he hasn't
taken it yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He'll get well anyway. Don't be a bit uneasy
about <em>him</em>,&rdquo; said the doctor, laughing, as he rung
off.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>&ldquo;It's time to go, John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary was drawing on her gloves. She looked
at her moveless husband as he sat before the
crackling blaze in the big fireplace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is better than church,&rdquo; he made reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you promised you would go tonight.
Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn't time yet, is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last bell will ring before we get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let's wait till all that singing's over.
That just about breaks my back.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" title="44"> </a>Mary sat down resignedly. If they missed the
singing perhaps John would not look at his watch
and sigh so loud during the sermon. And it
might not be a bad idea to miss the singing for
another reason. The last time John had gone to
church he had astonished her by sliding up beside
her, taking hold of the hymn-book and singing!
It happened to be his old favorite, &ldquo;Sweet
fields beyond the swelling flood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course it was lovely that he should want
to sing it with her&mdash;but the <em>way</em> he sang it! He
was in the wrong key and he came out two or
three syllables behind on most of the lines, but
undismayed by the sudden curtailment went
boldly ahead on the next. And Mary had been
much relieved when the hymn was ended and
the book was closed. So now she waited very
patiently for her husband to make some move
toward starting. By and by he got up and they
went out. No sooner was the door closed behind
them than the &ldquo;ting-a-ling-ling-ling&rdquo; was heard.
The doctor threw open the door and went back.
Mary, waiting at the threshold, heard one side of
the dialogue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shake up your 'phone. I can't hear <ins title="you.">you.&rdquo;</ins></p>

<p>&ldquo;That's better. Now what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swallowed benzine, did she? How much?... That
won't kill her. Give her some warm water
to drink. And give her a spoonful of mustard&mdash;anything
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" title="45"> </a>
to produce vomiting...... She has?
That's all right. Tell her to put her finger down
her throat and vomit some more..... No, I
think it won't be necessary for me to come down.....
You would? Well, let me hear again in
the next hour or two, and if you still want me
I'll come. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They walked down the street and as they drew
near the office they saw the figure of the office
boy in the doorway silhouetted against the light
within. He was looking anxiously in their direction.
Suddenly he disappeared and the faint
sound of a bell came to their ears. They quickened
their pace and as they came up the boy came
hurriedly to the door again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Doctor?&rdquo; he asked, peering out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told a lady at the 'phone to wait a minute,
she's 'phoned twice.&rdquo; Mary waited at the door
while her husband went into the office and over
to the 'phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. What is it?.... No. No. <em>No!</em>....
Listen to me..... Be <em>still</em> and listen to <em>me</em>! She's
in no more danger of dying than <em>you</em> are. She
couldn't die if she tried..... Be still, I say, and
listen to me!&rdquo; He stamped his foot mightily.
Mary laughed softly to herself. &ldquo;Now don't
hang over her and <em>sympathize</em> with her; that's
exactly what she don't need. And don't let the
neighbors hang around her either. Shut the
whole tea-party out..... Well, tell 'em <em>I</em> said so.....
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_46" title="46"> </a>
I don't care a damn <em>what</em> they think. Your
duty and mine is to do the very best we can for
that girl. Now remember..... Yes, I'll be down
on the nine o'clock train tomorrow morning.
Good-bye.&rdquo; He joined his wife at the door. &ldquo;If
anybody wants me, come to the church,&rdquo; he said,
turning to the boy.</p>

<p>Mary laid her hand within her husband's arm
and they started on. They met a man who
stopped and asked the doctor how soon he would
be at the office, as he was on his way there to get
some medicine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd better go back,&rdquo; said the doctor and back
they went. It seemed to Mary that her husband
might move with more celerity in fixing up the
medicine. He was deliberation itself as he cut
and arranged the little squares of paper. Still
more deliberately he heaped the little mounds of
white powder upon them. She looked on anxiously.
At last he was ready to fold them up!
No, he reached for another bottle. He took out
the cork, but his spatula was not in sight. Nowise
disturbed, he shifted bottles and little boxes about
on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can't you use your knife, Doctor?&rdquo; asked
Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I'll find it&mdash;it's around here somewhere.&rdquo;
In a minute or two the missing spatula was discovered
under a paper, and then the doctor
slowly, <em>so</em> slowly, dished out little additions to
the little mounds. Then he laid the spatula up,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" title="47"> </a>
put the cork carefully back in the bottle, turned
in his chair and put two questions to the waiting
man, turned back and folded the mounds in the
squares with the most painstaking care. In spite
of herself Mary fidgeted and when the powders
with instructions were delivered and the man had
gone, she rose hastily. &ldquo;<em>Do</em> come now before
somebody else wants something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The singing was over and the sermon just beginning
when they reached the church. It progressed
satisfactorily to the end. The doctor usually
made an important unit in producing that
&ldquo;brisk and lively air which a sermon inspires
when it is quite finished.&rdquo; But tonight, a few
minutes before the finale came, Mary saw the
usher advancing down the aisle. He stopped at
their seat and bending down whispered something
to the doctor, who turned and whispered something
to his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I'll stay and walk home with the Rands.
I see they're here,&rdquo; she whispered back.</p>

<p>The doctor rose and went out. &ldquo;Who's at the
office?&rdquo; he asked, as he walked away with the
boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's not there yet, she telephoned. I told
her you was at church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she say she couldn't wait?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said she had been at church too, but a
bug flew in her ear and she had to leave, and she
guessed you'd have to leave too, because she
couldn't stand it. She said it felt <em>awful</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_48" title="48"> </a>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was at a house by the Methodist church,
she said, when she 'phoned to see if you was
at the office. When I told her I'd get you from
the other church, she said she'd be at the office
by the time you got there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she was, sitting uneasily in a big chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, I've had a flea in my ear sometimes, but
this is a different proposition. Ugh! Please get
this creature out <em>now</em>. It feels as big as a bat.
Ugh! It's crawling further in, hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we'd better wait a minute and see if
it won't be like some other things, in at one ear
and out at the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, hurry, it'll get so far in you can't reach it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn more to the light,&rdquo; commanded the doctor,
and in a few seconds he held up the offending
insect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you only got a little of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it certainly felt a million times bigger
than that,&rdquo; and she departed radiantly happy.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" title="49"> </a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p>One day in early spring the doctor surprised
his wife by asking her if she would like to take
a drive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In March? The roads are not passable yet,
surely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the doctor assured her that the roads
were getting pretty good except in spots. &ldquo;I
have such a long journey ahead of me today that
I want you to ride out as far as Centerville and
I can pick you up as I come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's seven or eight miles. I'll go. I can
stop at Dr. Parkin's and chat with Mrs. Parkin
till you come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly a few minutes later the doctor
and Mary were speeding along through the town
which they soon left far behind them.</p>

<p>About two miles out they saw a buggy down
the road ahead of them which seemed to be at
a stand-still. When they drew near they found
a woman at the horses' heads with a broken strap
in her hand. She was gazing helplessly at the
buggy which stood hub-deep in mud. She recognized
the doctor and called out, &ldquo;Dr. Blank, if
ever I needed a doctor in my life, it's now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuck fast, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50"> </a>The doctor handed the reins to his wife and
got out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see&mdash;a broken single-tree. Well, I always
unload when I get stuck, so the first thing we
do we'll take this big lummox out of here,&rdquo; he
said picking his way to the buggy. The lummox
rose to her feet with a broad grin and permitted
herself to be taken out. She was a fat girl
about fourteen years old.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! I'll bet she weighs three hundred
pounds,&rdquo; observed the doctor when she was
landed, which was immediately resented. Then
he took the hitching-rein and tied the tug to the
broken end of the single-tree; after which he
went to the horses' heads and commanded them
to &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; They started and the next instant
the vehicle was on terra firma. Mother
and daughter gave the doctor warm thanks and
each buggy went its separate way.</p>

<p>Mary was looking about her. &ldquo;The elms have
a faint suspicion that spring is coming; the willows
only are quite sure of it,&rdquo; she said, noting
their tender greenth which formed a soft blur
of color, the only color in all the gray landscape.
No, there is a swift dash of blue, for a jay has
settled down on the top of a rail just at our travelers'
right.</p>

<p>Soon they were crossing a long and high
bridge spanning a creek which only a week before
had been a raging torrent; the drift, caught
and held by the trunks of the trees, and the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" title="51"> </a>
weeds and grasses all bending in one direction,
told the story. But the waters had subsided and
now lay in deep, placid pools.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, John, quick!&rdquo; commanded Mary when
they were about half way across. The doctor
obeyed wondering what could be the matter. He
looked at his wife, who was gazing down into
the pool beneath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I'm to stop while you count all the
fish you can see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was looking at that lovely concave sky
down there. See those two white clouds floating
so serenely across the blue far, far below the
tip-tops of the elm trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor drove relentlessly on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another mudhole,&rdquo; said Mary after a while,
&ldquo;but this time the travelers tremble on the brink
and fear to launch away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they came up they found a little girl
standing by the side of the horse holding up
over its back a piece of the harness. She held it
in a very aimless and helpless way. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; said
Mary, &ldquo;she doesn't know what to do a bit more
than I should. I wonder if she can be alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor got out and went forward to help
her and discovered a young man sitting cozily
in the carriage. He glanced at him contemptuously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your harness is broken, have you got a
string?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" title="52"> </a>&ldquo;N-n-o, I haven't,&rdquo; said the youth feeling
about his pockets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take your shoe-string. If you haven't got
one I'll give you mine,&rdquo; and he set his foot energetically
on the hub of the wheel to unlace his
shoe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I've got one here, I guess,&rdquo; and the
young man lifted a reluctant foot. The doctor
saw and understood. The little sister was to fix
the harness in order to save her brother's brand
new shoes from the mud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd better fix that harness yourself, my
friend, and fix it strong,&rdquo; was the doctor's parting
injunction as he climbed into the buggy and
started on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't like the looks of this slough of despond,&rdquo;
said Mary. The next minute the horses
were floundering through it, tugging with might
and main. Now the wheels have sunk to the
hubs and the horses are straining every muscle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merciful heaven!&rdquo; gasped Mary. At last they
were safely through, and the doctor looking back
said, &ldquo;That is the last great blot on our civilization&mdash;bad
roads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a while there came from across the
prairie the ascending, interrogative <em>boo-oo-m</em> of
a prairie chicken not far distant, while from far
away came the faint notes of another. And now
a different note, soft, melodious and mournful
is heard.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" title="53"> </a>&ldquo;How far away do you think that dove is?&rdquo;
asked the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds as if it might be half a mile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is right up here in this tree in the field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it,&rdquo; said Mary, looking up. &ldquo;Yes, I see,
it's as pretty and soft as its voice. But I'm getting
sunburned, John. How hot a March day
can get!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only two more miles and good road all the
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few minutes more and Mary was set down
at Centerville, &ldquo;I'll be back about sunset,&rdquo; announced
her husband as he drove off.</p>

<p>A very pleasant-faced woman answered the
knock at the door. She had a shingle in her hand
and several long strips of muslin over her arm.
She smilingly explained that she didn't often
meet people at the door with a shingle but that
she was standing near the door when the knock
came.</p>

<p>Mary, standing by the bed and removing hat
and gloves, looked about her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing with that shingle and
all this cotton and stuff, Mrs. Parkin?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven't you ever made a splint?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A splint? No indeed, I'm not equal to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's what I'm doing now. There's a boy
with a broken arm in the office in the next
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" title="54"> </a>&ldquo;Oh, your husband has his office here at the
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it's a nuisance sometimes, too, but
one gets used to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll watch you and learn something new about
the work of a doctor's wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'll learn then to have a lot of pillow slips
and sheets on hand. Old or new, Dr. Parkin
just tears them up when he gets in a hurry&mdash;it
doesn't matter to him what goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor's wife put cotton over the whole
length of the shingle and wound the strips of
muslin around it; then taking a needle and
thread she stitched it securely. Mary sat in her
chair watching the process with much interest.
&ldquo;You have made it thicker in some places than
in others,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; that is to fit the inequalities of the arm.&rdquo;
Mary looked at her admiringly. &ldquo;You are something
of an artist,&rdquo; she observed.</p>

<p>Just as Mrs. Parkin finished it her husband
appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it done?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's just finished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I see you put it on, Doctor?&rdquo; asked
Mary, rising and coming forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, good afternoon, Mrs. Blank. I'm glad
to see you out here. Yes, come right in. How's
the doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is well and happy&mdash;I think he expects
to cut off a foot this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" title="55"> </a>A boy with a frightened look on his face stood
in the doctor's office with one sleeve rolled up.
The doctor adjusted the fracture, then applied
the splint while his wife held it steady until he
had made it secure. When the splint was in
place and the boy had gone a messenger came to
tell the doctor he was wanted six miles away.</p>

<p>About half an hour afterward a little black-eyed
woman came in and said she wanted some
more medicine like the last she took.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctor's gone,&rdquo; said Mrs. Parkin, &ldquo;and
will not be back for several hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you can get it for me, can't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know the name of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I believe I could tell it if I saw it,&rdquo;
said the patient, going to the doctor's shelves
and looking closely at the bottles and phials with
their contents of many colors. She took up a
three-ounce bottle. &ldquo;This is like the other bottle
and I believe the medicine is just the same color.
Yes, I'm sure it is,&rdquo; she said, holding it up to
the light. Mary looked at her and then at Mrs.
Parkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't like to risk it,&rdquo; said the latter lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I'm not afraid. I don't want to wait until
the doctor comes and I know this must be like
the other. It's exactly the same color.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good woman,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;you <em>certainly</em>
will not risk that. It might kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mrs. Dawson, you must either wait till
the doctor comes or come again,&rdquo; said Mrs.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" title="56"> </a>
Parkin. The patient grumbled a little about
having to make an extra trip and took her leave.</p>

<p>When the door had closed behind her Mary
asked the other doctor's wife if she often had
patients like that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. People come here when the doctor
is away and either want me to prescribe for them
or to prescribe for themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't do it, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I do, when I am perfectly sure
what I am doing. Having the office here in the
house so many years I couldn't help learning a
few things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't prescribe for anything or anybody.
I'd be afraid of killing somebody.&rdquo; About
an hour later Mary, looking out of the window,
saw a wagon stopping at the gate. It contained
a man and a woman and two well-grown girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; called the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People call you out instead of coming in.
That is less trouble,&rdquo; observed Mary. The doctor's
wife went to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Doc at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he has gone to the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How soon will he be back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not before supper time, probably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man whistled, then looked at his wife
and the two girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sally,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I guess we'd better
git out and wait fur 'im.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" title="57"> </a>&ldquo;W'y, Pa, it'll be dark long before we git
home, if we do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't help that. I'm not agoin' to drive
eight miles tomorry or next day nuther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If ye'd 'a started two hour ago like I wanted
ye to do, maybe Doc'd 'a been here and we c'd
'a been purty nigh home by this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shet up! I told ye I wasn't done tradin'
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It don't take <em>me</em> all day to trade a few aigs
for a jug o' m'lasses an' a plug o' terbacker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer the head of the house told his
family to &ldquo;jist roll out now.&rdquo; They rolled out
and in a few minutes they had all rolled in. Mrs.
Parkin made a heroic effort not to look inhospitable
which made Mary's heroic effort not to
look amused still more heroic.</p>

<p>When at last the afternoon was drawing to a
close Mary went out into the yard to rest. She
wished John would come. Hark! There is the
ring of horses' hoofs down the quiet road. But
these are white horses, John's are bays. She
turns her head and looks into the west. Out in
the meadow a giant oak-tree stands between her
and the setting sun. Its upper branches are outlined
against the grey cloud which belts the entire
western horizon, while its lower branches
are sharply etched against the yellow sky beneath
the grey.</p>

<p>What a calm, beautiful sky it was!</p>

<p>She thought of some lines she had read more
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_58" title="58"> </a>
than once that morning ... a bit from George
Eliot's Journal:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How lovely to look into that brilliant distance
and see the ship on the horizon seeming to
sail away from the cold and dim world behind
it right into the golden glory! I have always
that sort of feeling when I look at sunset. It
always seems to me that there in the west lies
a land of light and warmth and love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A carriage was now coming down the road at
great speed. Mary saw it was her husband and
went in to put on her things. In a few minutes
more she was in the buggy and they were bound
for home. It was almost ten o'clock when they
got there. The trip had been so hard on the
horses that all the spirit was taken out of them.
The doctor, too, was exceedingly tired. &ldquo;Forty-two
miles is a long trip to make in an afternoon,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope Jack and Maggie are not up so late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be just like them to sit up till we
came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The buggy stopped; the door flew open and
Jack and Maggie stood framed in the doorway
with the leaping yellow firelight for a background.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_59" title="59"> </a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p>Once in a while sympathy for a fellow mortal
kept the doctor's wife an interested listener at
the <ins title="phone">'phone</ins>. Going, one morning, to speak to a
friend about some little matter she heard her
husband say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, doctor?&rdquo; A physician in a little
town some ten or twelve miles distant, who had
called Dr. Blank in consultation a few days before,
was calling him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think our patient is doing very well, but her
heart keeps getting a little faster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How fast is it now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About 120.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the disease is pretty well advanced now&mdash;that
doesn't mean as much as it would earlier.
But you might push a little on the brandy, or
the strychnine&mdash;how much brandy have you
given her since I saw her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have given her four ounces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four ounces!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four ounces in three days? I think you must
mean four drachms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Yes.</em> It <em>is</em> drachms. Four ounces <em>would</em> be
fixing things up. I've been giving her digitalis;
what do you think about that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_60" title="60"> </a>&ldquo;That's all right, but I think that strychnine
would be a little better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you give her any aromatic spirits of
ammonia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she rattle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you might give her a little of that.
And keep the room open and stick right to her
and she ought to get along. Don't give her
much to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is milk all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You bet it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right then, doctor, I believe that's all.
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On another occasion, Mary caught this fragment:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's so everlastin' sore that she just hollers
and yells every time I go near her. Would
you give her any more morphine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morphine's a thing you can't monkey with
you know, Doctor. You want to be mighty careful
about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I know. How long will that morphine
last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends on how you use it. It won't
last long if you use too much and neither will
she.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean how long will it last in the system?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O! Why, three or four hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think she don't need no more medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_61" title="61"> </a>Mary smiled at the double negative and when
she laughingly spoke of it that night her husband
assured her that that doctor's singleness
of purpose more than offset his doubleness of
negative. That he was a fine fellow and a good
physician just the same.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>One morning in March just as the doctor arose
from the breakfast table he was called to the
'phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, will it hurt the baby to bathe it
every <ins title="morning?&rdquo;">morning?</ins> I've been doing that but
some of the folks around here say I oughtn't to
do it; they say it isn't good for a baby to bathe
it so often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor answered solemnly, &ldquo;The baby's
fat and healthy isn't it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And pretty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, <em>sir</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Likes to see <ins title="it's">its</ins> mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>know</em> it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Likes to see its papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does that!&rdquo; said the young mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then ask me next fall if it will hurt to bathe
the baby every morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Doctor,&rdquo; laughed the baby's
mamma.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" title="62"> </a>&ldquo;The fools are not all dead yet,&rdquo; said John, as
he took his hat and departed. On the step he
turned back and put his head in at the door.
&ldquo;Keep an ear out, Mary. I'm likely to be away
from the office a good bit this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An hour later a call came. Mary put the ear
that was &ldquo;out&rdquo; to the receiver:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's on North Adams street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. I'll be out there after awhile,&rdquo;
said her husband's placid voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't wait too long. He may die before you
git here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he won't. I'll be along pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, come just as quick as you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and the listener knew that it
might be along toward noon before he got there.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock the 'phone rang sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank's house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw him pass here about twenty minutes
ago. I'm sure he'll be back to the office in a little
bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p><ins title="My">&ldquo;My</ins> land! I've been here three or four times.
Looks like I'd ketch him <em>some</em> time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are at the office then? If you will sit
down and wait just a little while, he will be in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I come six miles to see him. I supposed of
course he'd be in <em>some</em> time,&rdquo; grumbled the voice
(of course a woman's).</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when he is called to visit a patient he
must go, you know,&rdquo; explained Mary.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" title="63"> </a>&ldquo;Y-e-s,&rdquo; admitted the voice reluctantly. &ldquo;Well,
I'll wait here a little while longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Mary rang the office. Her
husband replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you been back, John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, five or ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you find a woman waiting for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I assured her you'd be there in a few
minutes and she said she'd wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know who she was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Some one from the country. She said
she came six miles to see you and she supposed
you'd be in your office <em>some</em> time, and that
sometime was <ins title="mightly">mightily</ins> emphatic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, yes, I know now. She'll be in again,&rdquo;
laughed the doctor and Mary felt relieved, for
in the querulous tones of the disappointed
woman she had read disapproval of the doctor
and of herself too, as the partner not only of
his joys and sorrows, but of his laggard gait as
well. The people who wait for a doctor are not
apt to consider that a good many more may be
waiting for him also at that particular moment
of time.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_64" title="64"> </a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p>One of the most discouraging things I have
encountered is a great blank silence. The doctor
asks his wife to keep a close watch on the
telephone for a little while, and leaves the office.
Pretty soon it rings and she goes to answer it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; Silence. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; More silence.
She knows that &ldquo;unseen hands or spirits&rdquo;
did not ring that bell. She knows perfectly well
that there is a listening ear at the other end of
the line. But you cannot converse with silence
any more than you can speak to a man you meet
on the street if he purposely looks the other way.</p>

<p>Mary knew that the listening ear belonged to
someone who recognized that it was the wife
who answered instead of the doctor, and
therefore kept silent. She smiled and hung up
the receiver&mdash;sorry not to be able to help her
husband and to give the needed information to
the patient.</p>

<p>But when this had happened several times she
thought of a more satisfactory way of dealing
with the situation. She would take down the
receiver and ask, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; She would wait
a perceptible instant and then say distinctly and
pleasantly, &ldquo;Doctor Blank will be out of the office
for about twenty minutes. He asked me to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_65" title="65"> </a>
tell you.&rdquo; That never failed to bring an answer,
a hasty, shame-voiced, &ldquo;Oh, I&mdash;well&mdash;thank
you, Mrs. Blank, I'll call again, then.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>The doctor's absence from town has its telephonic
puzzles. One day during Dr. Blank's
absence his wife was called to the 'phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Blank, a telegram has just come for the
doctor. What must I do with it?&rdquo; It was the
man at the office who put the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what it is, or where it's from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked the operator and he says it's from
Mr. Slocum, who is in Cincinnati. He telegraphed
the doctor to go and see his wife who
is sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, take it over to Dr. Brown's office and
ask him to go and see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About half an hour later the thought of the
telegram came into her mind. &ldquo;I wonder if he
found Dr. Brown in. I'd better find out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rang the office. &ldquo;Did you find Dr.
Brown in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you gave the message to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he took it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope he went right down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he said he wouldn't go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn't go!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary, much astonished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said he knew Slocum and he was in all
probability drunk when he sent the message.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_66" title="66"> </a>&ldquo;Why, what a queer conclusion to arrive at.
The doctor may be right but I think we ought
to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I called up their house after I came back from
Dr. Brown's office, but nobody answered. So
she can't be very sick or she'd be at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary put up the receiver hesitatingly. She
was not satisfied about this matter. She went
about her work, but her thoughts were on the
message and the sick wife. Suddenly she
thought of something&mdash;the Slocum children
were in school. The mother had not been able
to get to the 'phone to answer it. The thought
of her lying there alone and helpless was too
much. Mary went swiftly to the telephone and
called the office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnson, you have to pass Mrs. Slocum's on
your way to dinner. I think she may have been
too ill to go to the 'phone. Please stop and find
out something definite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And let me know as soon as you can. If she
isn't sick don't tell her anything about the telegram.
Think up some excuse as you go along
for coming in, in case all is well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In about twenty minutes the expected summons
came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I stopped, Mrs. Blank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you find?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I found a hatchet close to Slocum's
gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" title="67"> </a>&ldquo;How lucky!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took it in to ask if it was theirs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told you so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Slocum, herself, and she's about the
healthiest looking invalid I've seen lately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm much relieved. Thank you, Johnson.&rdquo;
And as she left the 'phone she meditated within
herself, &ldquo;Verily, the tender thoughtfulness of the
husband drunk exceedeth that of the husband
sober.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When night came and Mary was preparing
for bed she thought, &ldquo;It will be very unpleasant
to be called up only to tell people the doctor is
not here.&rdquo; She rose, went to the 'phone and
called central.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mrs. Blank, central. If anyone
should want the doctor tonight, or for the next
two nights, please say he is out of town and will
not be home until Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then with a delicious sense of freedom she
went to bed and slept as sweetly as in the long-ago
when the telephone was a thing undreamed
of.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>The ting-a-ling-ling-ling&mdash;came as Mary was
pouring boiling water into the teapot, just before
six on a cool July evening. The maid was temporarily
absent and Mary had been getting supper
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" title="68"> </a>
in a very leisurely way when she saw her
husband step up on the porch. Then her leisure
was exchanged for hurry. The doctor's appearance
before meal time was the signal to which
she responded automatically&mdash;he had to catch a
train&mdash;someone must have him right away, or
what not? She must not keep him waiting a
minute. She pushed the teapot back on the stove
and went swiftly to the 'phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank's office?&rdquo; asked a disturbed
feminine voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, his residence. He is here. Wait a minute,
please, and I will call him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hurried out to the porch, &ldquo;Isn't papa
here?&rdquo; she asked of her small boy sitting there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He <em>was</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, where is he now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know where he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Provoking! She hurried back. He must be
in the garden. An occasional impulse to hoe
sometimes came over him (especially if the day
happened to be Sunday).</p>

<p>In the kitchen her daughter stood at a table
cutting the bread for supper. &ldquo;Go quick, and
see if papa's in the garden. Tell him to come to
the 'phone at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she hurried back to re-assure the waiting
one. But what could she tell her? Perhaps the
doctor was not in the garden. She rushed out
and beat her daughter in the race toward it.
She sent her voice ahead, &ldquo;John!&rdquo; she called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_69" title="69"> </a>&ldquo;Come to the 'phone this minute.&rdquo; Back she
ran. Would she still be waiting?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the doctor's here. He's in the garden
but will be in in just a minute. Hold the 'phone
please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a minute and a half before the doctor
got there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo; No answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; Silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Hello!</em>&rdquo; Still no reply. The doctor rang
sharply for central.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was calling me a minute ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know&mdash;we can't keep track of everybody
who calls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor hung up the receiver with an explosive
monosyllable. Mary's patience was giving
out too. &ldquo;She couldn't wait one half minute.
I told her you would be here in a minute and it
took you a minute and a half.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She may be waiting at the office, I'll go down
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't do it,&rdquo; said Mary, warmly. &ldquo;It's
much easier for her to stay a half minute at the
'phone than for you to tramp back to the office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he went. As his wife went back to the
kitchen her daughter called, &ldquo;Mother, did you
take the loaf of bread in there with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_70" title="70"> </a>&ldquo;Well, it's not on the table where I was cutting
it when you sent me after father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's on the floor!&rdquo; shouted the small boy,
peering through the window. &ldquo;<em>I</em> won't eat any
of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't, exquisite child,&rdquo; said his sister, stooping
over to recover the loaf, dropped in her
haste. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Mary went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn't the doctor coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came. He called repeatedly, but got no
reply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was right here with my ear to the 'phone
the whole time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He concluded it might be someone waiting
for him at the office, so he has gone down there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm not there. I'm here at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; broke in the doctor's voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, here you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, I've been taking calomel today and
then I took some salts and I thoughtlessly dissolved
them in some lemonade I had handy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A solemn voice asked, &ldquo;Have you made your
will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little giggle before the patient said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'll have plenty of time. You needn't
hurry about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't think it will hurt me then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Not a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid the acid might salivate me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that's an old and popular idea. But it
won't.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" title="71"> </a><ins title="That">&ldquo;That</ins> sounds good, Doctor. I was awfully
scared. Much obliged. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>A week or two after the above incident the
doctor was seated at his dinner, a leisurely Sunday
dinner. The telephone called and he rose
and went to it. The usual hush fell upon
the table in order that he might hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Doctor, this is Mrs. Abner. Would it
be too much trouble for you to step into Hall's
and ask them to send me up a quart of ice-cream
for dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. A quart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, please. I'm sorry to bother you with it.
They ought to have a 'phone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor hung up the receiver and reached
for his hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, John, you surely can finish your dinner
before you go!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I'd spoil Mrs. Abner's dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Abner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she wants a quart of ice-cream for
dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd like to know what <em>you've</em> got to do with
it,&rdquo; said Mary tartly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She thinks I'm at the office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the office is next door to Hall's and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" title="72"> </a>
Hall's have no 'phone,&rdquo; said Mary smiling. &ldquo;Of
course you must go. Wouldn't Mrs. Abner feel
mortified though if she knew you had to leave
your home in the midst of dinner to order her
ice-cream. But do hurry back, John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I'd better stay there till the dinner
hour is well over,&rdquo; laughed John. &ldquo;Every now
and then someone wants me to step into Hall's
and order up something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went good-naturedly away and his wife
looked after him marveling, but withal admiring.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>The doctor and his wife had been slumbering
peacefully for an hour or two. Then came a
loud ring and they were wide awake at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wasn't the telephone, John, it was the
door-bell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor got into his dressing-gown and
went to the door.</p>

<p>His wife heard a man's voice, then her husband
reply, then the door shut. She lay back on
her pillow but it was evident John was not coming
back. She must have dozed, for it seemed
to her a long time had gone by when she started
to hear a noise in the other room. John had not
yet got off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to go some place, do you?&rdquo; she
called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;just a little way. Look out for the
'phone, Mary. I think I'll have to go down to
Hanson's tonight, to meet the stork.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" title="73"> </a>&ldquo;But how can I get word to you? They have
no 'phone or that man wouldn't have come
after you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have promised Hanson and I'll have
to go there. If he 'phones before I get back
tell him he'll have to come down to Stetson's
after me. Or, you might wake one of the boys
and send him over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd rather try to wake Rip Van Winkle,&rdquo; said
Mary, in a tone that settled it.</p>

<p>In about an hour the doctor was back and
snuggling down under the covers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They've got a fine boy over to Stetson's,&rdquo; he
announced to his sleepy wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have!&rdquo; she exclaimed, almost getting
awake. Again they slept.</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.
Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's Hanson,&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor springing
up and groping his way to the 'phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smith's on Parks avenue?.... <em>Not</em> Smith's?....
I understand&mdash;a little house farther down
that street..... Yes, I'll come..... O, as soon
as I can dress and get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary heard, but when he had gone, was soon
in a deep sleep.</p>

<p>By and by she found herself flinging off the
covers and hurrying guiltily toward the summoning
tyrant, her subconscious self telling her
that this was the third peal.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" title="74"> </a>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the doctor there, Mrs. Blank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he is over at Stetson's. He said if you
'phoned to tell you you would have to come there
as they have no 'phone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Mrs. Blank,&rdquo; said the voice
of central, <ins title="some">&ldquo;some</ins> one is trying to speak&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have I said!&rdquo; thought Mary suddenly,
thoroughly awake. &ldquo;He got back from Stetson's
and went to another place. But I don't know
what place nor where it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kindly voice of central went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's the doctor who is talking, Mrs. Blank.
I understand now. He says if that message
comes you are to 'phone him at James Smith's
on Parks avenue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary looked at the clock. &ldquo;So he's been
there all this time. That stork is a little too
busy tonight,&rdquo; she thought as she went shivering
back to bed.</p>

<p>Toward daylight she was roused by the return
of her husband, who announced a new daughter
in the world and then they went to sleep. The
next morning she said, &ldquo;John, I've just thought
of something. Why didn't you have central
'phone you at Smith's if Hanson called and save
me all that bother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it's because I'm so used to bothering
you Mary, that I didn't think of it.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" title="75"> </a>Mary was upstairs cleaning house most vigorously
when the ring came. She stopped and
listened. It came again&mdash;three. She set the
dust pan down and went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll have to be out for an hour or more,
Mary,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard that sigh,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;but it won't
be very hard to sort of keep an ear on the 'phone,
will it? Johnson may get in soon and then it
won't be necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, John,&rdquo; and she went upstairs,
leaving the doors open behind her.</p>

<p>She had just reached the top when she had to
turn about and retrace her steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo; No answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is someone calling Dr. Blank's house or
office?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rang your 'phone by mistake,&rdquo; said central.
Mary trudged up the stairs again. &ldquo;This is
more tiresome than cleaning house,&rdquo; she said to
herself as she went along.</p>

<p>In twenty minutes the summons came. She
leaned her broom against the wall and went
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, this is Mrs. Blank. I'm very sorry to
have put you to this trouble&mdash;I wanted the
doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She recognized the voice of her old pastor for
whom she had a most kindly regard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is out, but will be back within half an
hour now, Mr. Rutledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_76" title="76"> </a>&ldquo;Thank you, I'll call again, but I wonder that
you knew my voice.&rdquo; Mary laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven't heard it for awhile, but maybe I'll
be at church next Sunday, if minding the telephone
doesn't make me feel too wicked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's the wicked that church is for&mdash;come by
all means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't mean to detain you, Mr. Rutledge.
It is restful, though, after dragging one's weary
feet down to the 'phone to hear something beside
all the ills that flesh is heir to. Come to
see us soon&mdash;one day next week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more she wended her way upstairs and
in about fifteen minutes came the ting-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling.
&ldquo;I surrender!&rdquo; she declared.</p>

<p>When she had gone down and put the receiver
to her ear her husband's voice spoke kindly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm back, Mary, you're released.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, John, you are very thoughtful,&rdquo;
and she smiled as she took off her sun-bonnet
and sat herself down. &ldquo;Not another time will
I climb those stairs this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Mary sat one evening dreamily thinking about
them&mdash;these messages that came every day, every
day!</p>

<p>Doctor, will it hurt Jennie to eat some tomatoes
this morning&mdash;she craves them so?</p>

<p>Will is a great deal better. Can he have some
ice-cream for dinner?</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" title="77"> </a>I can hardly manage Henry any longer, Doctor,
he's determined he <em>will</em> have more to eat.
Can I begin giving him a little more today?</p>

<p>Lemonade won't hurt Helen, will it? She
wants some.</p>

<p>Doctor, I forget how many drops of that clear
medicine I am to give..... Ten, you say? Thank
you.</p>

<p>Dr. Blank, is it after meals or before that the
dark medicine is to be given..... I thought so,
but I wanted to be sure.</p>

<p>We are out of those powders you left. Do
you think we will need any more?.... Then I'll
send down for them.</p>

<p>How long will you be in the office this morning,
Doctor?...... Very well, I'll be down in
about an hour. I want you to see my throat.</p>

<p>You wanted me to let you know how Johnny
is this morning. I don't think he has any fever
now and he slept all night, so I guess you won't
need to come down today.</p>

<p>Dr. Blank, I've got something coming on my
finger. Do you suppose it's a felon?.... You
can tell better when you see it?.... Well, I suppose
you can. I'll be down at the office pretty
soon and then I want you to tell me it's <em>not</em> a
felon.</p>

<p>Mary seems a good deal better this morning,
but she still has that pain in her side.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" title="78"> </a>Doctor, I don't believe Joe is as well as he
was last night. I think you had better come
down.</p>

<p>As these old, old stories came leisurely into
Mary's thoughts the telephone rang three times.
She rose from her chair before the fire and went
to answer it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank's office?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, his residence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the doctor there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but he will be down on the seven o'clock
train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it's now not quite six. This is Mr. Andrews.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary knew the name and the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife is sick and I want to get a pint of
alcohol for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An old subterfuge,&rdquo; thought Mary, &ldquo;I'm
afraid he wants it for himself.&rdquo; She knew that
he was often under its influence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't get it without a prescription from a
physician, you know. She needs it right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thirst is on him,&rdquo; thought our listener,
pityingly.</p>

<p>The voice went on, &ldquo;Mrs. Blank, couldn't you
just speak to the druggist about it so I could
get it right away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Andrews,&rdquo; she said hastily, &ldquo;the druggist
would pay no attention to me. I'm not a
physician, you know. The doctor will be here
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" title="79"> </a>
in an hour&mdash;see him,&rdquo; and she hurried the receiver
into its place, anxious to get away from
it. This was a story that was entirely new to
her. Never before had she been asked to procure
a prescription for alcohol or any of its attendant
spirits. She liked the old stories best.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>The doctor had been to the city and had got
home at four o'clock in the morning. He had
had to change cars in the night and consequently
had had little sleep. When the door-bell rang
his wife awakened instantly at the expected summons
and rose to admit him. In a little while
both were fast asleep. The wife, about a half
hour later, found herself struggling to speak to
somebody about something, she did not know
what. But when the second long peal came
from the 'phone she was fully awakened. How
she hated to rouse the slumberer at her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; she called softly. He did not move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John!&rdquo; a little louder. He stirred slightly,
but slept on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, <em>John</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh-h?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The telephone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He threw back the covers, and rising, stumbled
to the 'phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice of a little boy came to his half-awakened
ear.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" title="80"> </a>&ldquo;<em>Say</em>, Pa, <em>I</em> can't sell these papers an' git
through in time fer school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you <em>can</em>!&rdquo; roared a voice. <ins title="You">&ldquo;You</ins> jist want
to fool around.&rdquo; The doctor went back to bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn't the message for you?&rdquo; inquired his
wife. &ldquo;What a shame to rouse you from your
sleep for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor told her what the message was and
was back in slumberland in an incredibly short
space of time. Not so his wife. She was too
thoroughly awake at last and dawn was beginning
to peep around the edges of the window
shades. She would not court slumber now but
would lie awake with her own thoughts which
were very pleasant thoughts this morning. By
and by she rose softly, dressed and went out onto
the veranda and looked long into the reddening
eastern sky. Ever since she could remember she
had felt this keen delight at the aspect of the
sky in the very early morning. She stood for
awhile, drinking in the beauty and the peacefulness
of it all. Then she went in to her awakening
household, glad that the little boy had
'phoned his &ldquo;Pa&rdquo; and by some means had got
her too.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>One midsummer night a tiny ringing came
faintly and pleasantly into Mary's dreams. Not
till it came the second or third time did she
awaken to what it was. Then she sat up in bed
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" title="81"> </a>
calling her husband, who had just awakened too
and sprung out of bed. Dazed, he stumbled
about and could not find his way. With Mary's
help he got his bearings and the next minute his
thunderous &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; greeted her ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse tonight? In what way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>An instant's silence. &ldquo;Mrs. Brownson?&rdquo; Silence.
&ldquo;Mrs. Brownson!&rdquo; Silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn that woman! She's rung off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don't swear into the 'phone, John. It's
against the rules. Besides, she might hear you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor was growling his way to his
clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I've got to go down there,&rdquo; was
all the answer he made. When he was dressed
and the screen had banged behind him after the
manner of screens, Mary settled herself to sleep
which came very soon. But she was soon routed
out of it. She went to the 'phone, expecting
to hear a querulous woman's voice asking, &ldquo;Has
the doctor started yet?&rdquo; and her lips were framing
the old and satisfactory reply, &ldquo;Yes, he must
be nearly there now,&rdquo; when a man's voice asked,
&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank's residence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the doctor there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but he will be back in about twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please tell him to come to J.&nbsp;H.
Twitchell's?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" title="82"> </a>&ldquo;Yes, I'll send him right down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went back to her bed room then, turning,
retraced her steps. The doctor could come home
by way of Twitchell's as their home was not a
great distance from the Brownson's.</p>

<p>She rang the Brownson's and after a little
while a voice answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Mrs. Brownson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I speak to Dr. Blank. I think he must
be there now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's been here. He's gone home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary knew by the voice that its owner had
not enjoyed getting out of bed. &ldquo;I wonder how
she would like to be in my place,&rdquo; she thought,
smiling. She dared not trust herself to her pillow.
She might fall asleep and not waken when her
husband came in. She wondered what time it
was. Up there on the wall the clock was ticking
serenely away&mdash;she had only to turn the
button beside her to find out. But she did not
turn it. In the sweet security of the dark she
felt safe. In one brief flash of light some prowling
burglar might discover her.</p>

<p>She sat down by the open window and
looked up into the starlit sky. They were
out tonight in countless numbers. Over
there toward the northwest, lying along
the tops of the trees was the Great Dipper.
Wasn't it? Surely that particular curve
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" title="83"> </a>
in the handle was not to be found in any other
constellation. She tried to see the Dipper itself
but a cherry tree near her window blotted it out.
Bend and peer as she might the branches intervened.
It was tantalizing. She rose irresolute.
Should she step out doors where the cherry tree
would not be in the way? Not for a thousand
dippers! She walked to another window. That
view shut even the handle out. She looked for
the Pleiades. They were not in the section of
sky visible from the window where she stood.
She turned and listened. Did she hear footsteps
down the walk? She ought to be hearing
her husband's by this time. He could not be
walking at his usual gait. There he came! She
went to the door looked through the screen and
halted him as he drew near the steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, you'll have to take another trip. Mr.
Twitchell has 'phoned for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned and was soon out of sight. &ldquo;Now!
I can go to bed with a clear conscience,&rdquo; and
Mary sought her pillow. But she had better
stay awake until he had time to get there lest Mr.
Twitchell should 'phone again. In five or ten
minutes the danger would be over. She waited.
At last she closed her eyes to sleep. But what
would be the use? In twenty minutes more her
husband would come in and rouse her out of it.
She had better just keep awake till he got back.
And the next thing Mary heard was a snore. She
opened her eyes to find it was broad daylight and
her husband was sleeping soundly beside her.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" title="84"> </a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p>One afternoon in June Mary went into her
husband's office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has <cite>The Record</cite> come?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it's on the table in the next room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went into the adjoining room and seated
herself by the table. Taking up <cite>The Record</cite>,
she turned to the editorial page, but before she
could begin reading she heard a voice in the
office say, &ldquo;How do you do, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Jenkins. Take a seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I guess I'll not sit down. I just wanted
to get&mdash;a prescription.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The baby's better, isn't it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the baby's all right, but I want a prescription
for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of prescription?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to take a long ride in the morning,
driving cattle, and I want a prescription for a
pint of whiskey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary listened for her husband's reply. It
came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jenkins, I have taken many a long ride
through dust and heat, through rain and snow
and storm, and I never yet have had to take any
whiskey along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have a little trouble with my heart
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" title="85"> </a>&ldquo;The trouble's in your head. If you'd throw
away that infernal pipe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it's no use to lecture me on that any
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, your tobacco may be worth more
to you than your heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, will you give me that prescription?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly I won't. You don't need whiskey
and you'll not get it from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to h-ll!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I'll meet <em>you</em> there.&rdquo; At which
warm farewell between these two good friends,
Mary leaned back in her chair and laughed silently.
Then she mused: &ldquo;People will not be
saved from themselves. If only they would be,
how much less of sin and sickness and sorrow
there would be in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently the doctor came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a trip to make tonight, Mary. How
would you like a star-light drive?&rdquo; Mary said
she would like it very much indeed.</p>

<p>Accordingly, at sunset the doctor drove up and
soon they were out in the open country. Chatting
of many things they drove along and by and
by Mary's eyes were attracted to a beautiful
castle up in the clouds in the west, on a great
golden rock jutting out into the blue. Far below
was a grand woman's form in yellow floating
robes. She stood with face upturned and
arms extended in an attitude of sorrow as if
she had been banished from her father's house.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" title="86"> </a>There comes the father now. Slowly, majestically,
an old man with flowing beard of gold
moves toward the edge of the great rock. Now
he has reached it. He bends his head and looks
below. The attitude of the majestic woman has
changed to that of supplication. And now the
father stretches down forgiving arms and the
queenly daughter bows her head against the
mighty wall and weeps in gladness. Now castle
and rock, father and daughter slowly interchange
places and vanish from her sight. The gold
turns to crimson, then fades to gray. Just before
her up there in the clouds is a huge lion, couchant.
See! he is going to spring across the pale
blue chasm to the opposite bank. If he fails he
will come right down into the road&mdash;&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the doctor, looking
around, and Mary told him with a rather foolish
smile.</p>

<p>The twilight deepened into dusk and the notes
of a whippoorwill came to them from a distance.
&ldquo;You and I must have nothing but sweet
thoughts right now, John, because then we'll get
to keep them for a year.&rdquo; She quoted:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&ldquo;'Tis said that whatever sweet feeling<br/></div>
<div class="line indent2">May be throbbing within the fond heart,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent2">When listening to a whippoorwill s-pieling,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent2">For a twelvemonth will never depart.&rdquo;<br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Spieling doesn't seem specially in the whippoorwill's
line.&rdquo;</p>

<p><ins title="It's">&ldquo;It's</ins> <em>exactly</em> in his line. Years ago when I was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" title="87"> </a>
a little girl he proved it. One evening at dusk
I was sitting in an arbor when he, not suspecting
my presence, alighted within a few feet of me
and began his song. It was wonderfully interesting
to watch his little throat puff and puff with the
notes as they poured forth, but the thing that astounded
me was the length of time he sang without
ever pausing for breath. And so he is a
genuine spieler. I will add, however, that the
line is &lsquo;When listening to a whippoorwill <em>singing</em>.&rsquo;
But my literary conscience will never let
me rhyme <em>singing</em> with <em>feeling</em>, hence the sudden
change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I'll speak <em>my</em> piece,&rdquo; announced the
doctor:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&ldquo;De frogs in de pon' am a singin' all de night;<br/></div>
<div class="line indent3">Wid de hallelujah campmeetin' tune;<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">An' dey all seem to try wid deir heart, soul and might<br/></div>
<div class="line indent3">To tell us ob de comin' of de June.&rdquo;<br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Aren't</em> they having a hallelujah chorus over
in that meadow, though!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darkness settled over the earth. The willow
trees, skirting the road for a little distance, lifted
themselves in ghostly tracery against the starlit
sky. A soft breeze stirred their branches like
the breath of a gentle spirit abiding there. They
passed a cozy farmhouse nestled down among
tall trees. Through the open door they could
see a little white-robed figure being carried to
bed in its father's arms, while the mother crooned
a lullaby over the cradle near.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" title="88"> </a>For a long time they drove in silence. Mary
knew that her husband was in deep thought. Of
what was he thinking? The pretty home scene
in the farm house had sent him into a reverie.
He went back five or six years to a bright spring
day. He was sitting alone in his office when an
old man, a much respected farmer, came in
slowly, closed the door behind him and sat down.
The doctor who knew him quite well saw that
he was troubled and asked if there was anything
he could do for him. The old man leaned his
head on his hand but did not reply. It seemed
that no words would come in which to tell his
errand.</p>

<p>Puzzled and sympathetic the doctor sat silent
and waited. In a little while the farmer drew
his chair very near to that of the doctor's and
said in a low voice, &ldquo;Doctor, I'm in deep trouble.
I come to you because you are one of my best
friends. You have a chance to prove it now
such as you never had before in all the years
you've been our doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me your trouble and if I can help you,
I will certainly do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's Mary. She's gone wrong, and the disgrace
will kill her mother if she finds it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For an instant the doctor did not speak; then
he asked, &ldquo;Are you sure that this is true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. She came to me last night and nestled
down in my arms, just as she's done every night
since she was a baby. She cried like her heart
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" title="89"> </a>
would break and then she said, <ins title="&ldquo;Father">&lsquo;Father</ins>, I <em>must</em>
tell you, but don't tell <ins title="mother">mother&rsquo;</ins>; and then she told
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man, white and trembling, looked beseechingly
at the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, this must not be. You must stop it
before there is any breath of scandal. Oh, for a
minute last night I wanted to kill her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor's face was stern. &ldquo;If you had
killed her your crime would have been far less
hellish than the one you ask me to commit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man bowed his head upon his hands.
&ldquo;You will not help me,&rdquo; he groaned.</p>

<p>The doctor rose and walked the floor. &ldquo;No,
sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will not stain my soul with murder
for you or any other man.&rdquo; He went to the
window and stood looking out upon the street
below. Presently he said, &ldquo;Mr. Stirling, will
you come here a minute?&rdquo; The old man rose
and went. &ldquo;Do you see that little boy skipping
along down there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I should go down these stairs, seize him
and dash his brains out against that building,
what would you think of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd think you were a devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet he would have a chance for his life. He
could cry out, or the passersby might see me and
interpose, while that you ask me to destroy is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's one thing I'll do,&rdquo; said the old man
fiercely. &ldquo;I'll kill Ben Morely before this day
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_90" title="90"> </a>
is over!&rdquo; He seized his hat and started toward
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; said the doctor quickly.
&ldquo;It's Ben Morely is it? I know him. I would
not have thought him capable of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's been coming to see Mary steady for
more than a year and they were to have been
married three months ago but they quarreled
and Mary told me last night that he was going
away the last of this week. She is as good and
sweet a girl as ever lived. She never kept company
with anybody else and she thought the
world of him. The damned villain has got
around her with his honey words and now he
proposes to leave her to face it alone. But I'll
kill him as sure as the sun shines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said the doctor, laying a hand on
the excited man's arm and forcing him into a
chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you what to do. Young Morely's
father is a good and sensible man and will take
the right view of it. Go straight to him and tell
him all about it and my word for it, he will see
that they are married right away. He is able to
help them along and will make it to his son's
advantage to stay here rather than go away. He
will advise him right. Have no fear.&rdquo; The
old man wrung the doctor's hand in silence and
went out.</p>

<p>Several days later the doctor was looking over
the papers published in the town and read in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_91" title="91"> </a>
the list of marriage licenses the names, &ldquo;Benjamin
Morely, aged twenty-four, Mary Stirling,
aged eighteen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that is why the scene in the farmhouse
this summer night had sent him back into the
past, for it was the home of Benjamin and Mary
Morely, and it was a happy home. These two
lives had come together and flowed on in such
harmony and helpfulness and rectitude before
the world that the stain had been wiped out.
For a merciless world can be merciful sometimes
if it will only stop to remember that long ago
a compassionate Voice said, Go and sin no more.</p>

<p>The doctor's reverie came to an end for he had
reached his destination&mdash;a large white house
standing very close to the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't talk to me while you are hitching the
horse,&rdquo; Mary whispered, &ldquo;then they won't know
there is anyone with you. I don't want to go in&mdash;I
want to see the moon come up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor took his case and went inside.
Mary sat in the buggy and listened. The neighing
of a horse far down the road and the barking
of a dog in the distance were the only sounds
she heard. How still and cool it was after the
heat of the day. A wandering breeze brought
the sweet perfume of dewy clover fields. She
looked across the intervening knoll to the east.
The tree that crowned its summit stood outlined
against the brightening sky. She was sitting
very near the open kitchen window and now
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_92" title="92"> </a>
saw the family taking their places around the
supper table. She felt a little uncomfortable and
as if she were trespassing on their privacy. But
they did not know of her proximity and she
could only sit still in the friendly cover of the
darkness. How good the ham smelled and the
potatoes and the coffee.</p>

<p>A pretty home-scene!</p>

<p>The father at the head of the table, the mother
opposite with four sturdy boys between them,
two on each side. The father looked around the
board. Stillness settled down upon them, and
then he bowed his head. The mother, too, bowed
her head. The boys looked down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our heavenly Father, we thank Thee for
these evening blessings&mdash;&rdquo; the boys looked up
and four forks started simultaneously for the
meat platter. Every fork impaled its slice. Mary
gasped. She crammed her handkerchief into her
mouth to shut off the laughter that almost
shouted itself before she could stop it.</p>

<p>The oldest boy, a burly fellow of fifteen, looked
astonished and then sheepish. The other three
looked defiance at him. Each sat erect in perfect
silence and held his slice to the platter with
a firm hand. Mary, almost suffocating with
laughter which <em>must</em> be suppressed, watched
anxiously for the denouement. The blessing
went on. The boys evidently knew all its stages.
As it advanced there was a tightening of the
tension and at the welcome &ldquo;amen&rdquo; there was a
grand rake-off.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" title="93"> </a>At the commotion of the sudden swipe the
father and mother looked up in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys, boys! what do you mean!&rdquo; exclaimed
the mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We got even with Mr. Jake that time.&rdquo; It
was the second boy who spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We got <em>ahead</em> of him,&rdquo; said the third. &ldquo;He
didn't get the biggest piece this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, <em>I</em> got it myself,&rdquo; said the fourth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I'm scandalized,&rdquo; said the mother,
looking across the table at her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mother, I'll tell you how it was,&rdquo; said
the second boy. &ldquo;Last night I looked up before
Father was through with the blessing and I saw
Jake with his fork in the biggest piece of ham.
You and Father didn't notice and so he was <em>it</em>.
I'll bet he's been at it a good while, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've not, either,&rdquo; said the accused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told Bob and Jim about it and we concluded
<em>we'd</em> take a hand in it tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let this be the last of it,&rdquo; said the father
with mild sternness. &ldquo;We'll try to have ham
enough for all of you without sneaking it. If
not, Jacob can have his mother's share and
mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trio of boys grinned triumphantly at the
discomfited Jake, then, the little flurry over, all
fell to eating with a will.</p>

<p>The doctor's voice came to Mary from the
room of the patient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're worth a dozen dead women yet,&rdquo; it
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" title="94"> </a>
said. Then a high pitched woman's voice, &ldquo;I'll
tell you what Mary Ann says she thinks about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she been here today?&rdquo; If Mary Ann had
been there the unfavorable condition of the patient
was explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she just went away. She says she believes
you're just keepin' Ellen down so you can
get a big bill out of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><ins title="&ldquo;The">The</ins> doctor was fixing up powders and went
placidly on till he got through, then he said
&ldquo;Mary Ann has a better opinion of me than I
thought she had. It takes a mighty good doctor
to do that. That's a very old song but there are
a few people in the world that like to sing it
yet. They don't know that there isn't a doctor
in the world that knows enough to do a thing
like that even if he wanted to. Nature would
beat him every time if they gave her a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary heard the doctor give his instructions
and then he came out. As they drove off she
asked, &ldquo;You came pretty near catching a tartar,
didn't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that one is all right. It's her sister
that's always raising the devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look! isn't she lovely, John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn't who lovely?&rdquo; asked the doctor, looking
back at the house in some surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentle Shepherdess of Night,&rdquo; Mary answered,
her eyes on the moon just rising over
the distant treetops.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_95" title="95"> </a>&ldquo;She's getting ready to &lsquo;lead her flocks
through the fields of blue.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very poetical we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only an echo from a little song I used to sing
when I was a little girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get up, my steeds,&rdquo; urged the doctor, &ldquo;we
must be getting back&rdquo;; and they sped swiftly
homeward through the soft summer night.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_96" title="96"> </a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.
Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the doctor's office?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is his residence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! I wanted his <em>office</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctor 'phoned me about ten minutes ago
that he would be out for half an hour and asked
me to answer the 'phone in his absence,&rdquo; Mary
explained, pleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the voice, somewhat mollified, <ins title="I'll">&ldquo;I'll</ins>
just call him up when he gets back. You say
he'll be back in half an hour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In about that time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went back to her work, which happened
to be upstairs this morning, leaving the doors
ajar behind her that she might hear the 'phone.
In two minutes she was summoned down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the doctor's office?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, the residence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rang for the office, sorry to have troubled
you, Mrs. Blank,&rdquo; said a man's voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are connected and when the doctor is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_97" title="97"> </a>
out he expects me to be bell-boy,&rdquo; said Mary,
recognizing the voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. Will you please tell the doctor
when he comes that my little boy is sick this
morning and I want him to come down. Will
he be back soon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a few minutes, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sat down by the fire. No use to go back
upstairs till she had delivered the message. This
was a pleasing contrast to the other; Mr. Owen
had volunteered his message as if she really had
a right to know and deliver it.</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.
Mary felt reluctant to answer it&mdash;it sounded so
like the first. And it was not the house call this
time, but two rings which undeniably meant the
office. But she must be true to the trust reposed
in her. She went to the 'phone and softly taking
down the receiver, listened; perhaps the doctor
had got back and would answer it himself. Fervently
she hoped so. But there was only silence
at her ear, and the ever present far-off clack of
attenuated voices. The silence seemed to bristle.
But there was nothing for our listener to do but
thrust herself into it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; she said, very gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I've got <em>you</em> again, have I! I <em>know</em> I
rung the office this time, for I looked in the book
to see. How does it happen I get the house?&rdquo;
Ill temper was manifest in every word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The office and residence are connected,&rdquo; explained
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" title="98"> </a>
Mary, patiently, &ldquo;and when the 'phone
rings while the doctor is out, he asks me to answer
it for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see what good <em>that</em> does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn't do any good when people do not
care to leave a message,&rdquo; said Mary quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I'd ruther deliver my message to <em>him</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. And I would much rather you
would. I can at least say about what time he expects
to return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said awhile ago he'd be back in half an
hour and he's not back <em>yet</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor's wife knew that she was held responsible
for the delay. She smiled and glanced
at the clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is just three minutes past the half hour,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we're in an awful hurry for him. I'll
ring agin d'reckly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In five minutes a ring came again. Surely he
would be there now, thought his wife, but she
must go to the 'phone. She listened. Silence.
Then the bell pealed sharply forth again. She
decided to change her tactics and put the other
woman on the defensive:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she said impatiently, &ldquo;I'm <em>very</em> sorry
to have to answer you again but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the doctor there?&rdquo; asked a sweet, new
voice. &ldquo;Pardon me for interrupting you, but I'm
very anxious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will be at the office in just a few minutes,&rdquo;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" title="99"> </a>
Mary answered, very gently indeed. She realized
now that one cannot &ldquo;monkey&rdquo; with the
telephone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please tell him to come at once?&rdquo;
and she gave the street and number.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall send him at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Mary could seat herself, the expected
ring came in earnest. She answered it meekly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, good gracious! hain't he got there yet&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Mary, offering nothing further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I've jist <em>got</em> to have a doctor. I'll git
some one else.&rdquo; The threat in the tone made
our listener smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would be a good thing to do,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>A pause. Then a voice with softening accents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I'd lots ruther have Dr. Blank.&rdquo; No
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are ye there yit, Mrs. Blank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I am here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He'll surely be back in a little bit now, won't
he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won't <em>you</em> tell 'im to come down to Sairey
Tucker's? I'm her sister and she's bad sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will tell me where you live I will send
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He knows&mdash;he's been here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; and she rang off.</p>

<p>With three messages hanging over her head
and her conscience, she could not go upstairs to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_100" title="100"> </a>
her work. She must dawdle about at this or that
'till the doctor returned. After awhile she went
to the 'phone and called the office. No reply.
How she longed to deliver those messages. She
dreaded any more calls from the waiting ones.
She waited a few minutes then rang again.
Thank fortune! Her husband's response is in
her ear, the messages are delivered and she goes
singing up the stairs.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>It was the telephone on the Doctor's office table
and a tall young fellow was ringing it. When he
got the number and asked, &ldquo;Is this you, Fanny?&rdquo;
his face took on an expression good to see. It
was Fanny, and he settled back on one elbow and
asked, &ldquo;What you doing, Fanny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, just now. What <em>you</em> doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something a good deal better than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's talking to <em>you</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all you have to say about it?&rdquo; his voice
was growing tender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Tom, don't go to making love to me
over the 'phone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I help it, sweetheart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you, anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm in Dr. Blank's office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! is <em>he</em> there? I'll ring off&mdash;good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" title="101"> </a>&ldquo;Wait! Fanny&mdash;Fanny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny was waiting, but how could a mere
man know that. He rang the number again
with <ins title="vehemence.&rdquo;">vehemence.</ins></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Tom Laurence, I want you to quit going
into people's offices and talking to me this
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you think my way is nicer than yours&mdash;huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The circumflexes were <ins title="irresistible.&rdquo;">irresistible.</ins></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, tell me, Tom, is Dr. Blank there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, honey. He's away in the back room busy
with another patient. He can't hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Another</em> patient? Why, Tom, you're not <em>sick</em>,
are you&mdash;huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny's circumflexes were quite as circumflexible
as Tom's and a thrill went down the young
giant's spine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I wish I was!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this juncture the man who could not hear
came in with a face as grave and non-committal
as the Sphinx, and the young man asked through
the 'phone in brisk, cheery tones, &ldquo;How are you
this morning?&rdquo; then added in a whisper, &ldquo;He's
here now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he? Don't talk foolish then. Why, I'm
not very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I burned my eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burned your eye! Confound it! How did
you <em>do</em> it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_102" title="102"> </a>&ldquo;With a curling iron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw the darned thing away.&rdquo; He turned
from the telephone and said, &ldquo;Doctor, a young
lady has burned her eye. I want you to go out
there right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where shall I go?&rdquo; asked the grave doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you know,&rdquo; and he grinned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. I'll go pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't be too long. Charge it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; he said, turning back to the 'phone,
but Fanny had gone.</p>

<p>And soon with a smile that had memories in
it the doctor took his case and left the office, the
young man at his side.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>Mary, from the living room, heard her husband's
voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won't? O, I suppose so if nobody else
will. I'll be up there in a little bit.&rdquo; He muttered
something, took his hat and went.</p>

<p>When he came back, he said, &ldquo;This time I had
to help the dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To help the dead!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. To help a dead woman into her coffin.
Everybody was afraid to touch her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The report got out that she died of smallpox.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" title="103"> </a>
I only saw her once and could not be sure, but
to be on the safe side I insisted that every precaution
be taken&mdash;hence the scare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how could you lift the body without
help?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I managed it somehow. Just the same
I'd rather minister to the living,&rdquo; said John, to
which Mary gave vigorous assent.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>&ldquo;Old Mr. Vintner has just been 'phoning for
you in a most imperious way,&rdquo; announced Mary
as the doctor came in at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, old skinflint! The maid at his house is
very sick and he's so afraid they'll have to take
care of her that he's determined to send her
home when she can't go. She has pneumonia.
She lives miles out in the country&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now see here, Vintner. Listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. But a man's got to be <em>human</em>.
I tell you you can't send her out in this cold.
It's outrageous to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know all that, too. But it won't be
long&mdash;the crisis will come in a day or two now
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn it! Listen. Now stop that and listen.
Don't you attempt it! That girl will be to drag
off if you do, I tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right then. That sounds more like it,&rdquo;
and he hung up the receiver.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" title="104"> </a>Mary looked up. &ldquo;You are not very elegant in
your discourse at times, John, but I'm glad you
beat,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>One evening the doctor came in and walked
hurriedly into the dining-room. As he was
passing the telephone it rang sharply in his ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, hastily putting up the
receiver.</p>

<p>An agitated voice said, &ldquo;Oh, Doctor, I've just
given my little girl a teaspoonful of carbolic acid!
Quick! What must I do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give her some whiskey at once; then a teaspoonful
of mustard in hot water. I'll be right
down,&rdquo; and turning he went swiftly out. When
he came back an hour or two later he said:
&ldquo;The mother got the wrong bottle. A very few
minutes would have done the work. The telephone
saved the child's life. This is a glorious
age in which we are living, Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And to think that some little children playing
with tin cans with a string stretched between
them, gave to the world its first telephone
message.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I've heard that. It may or may not be
true. Now let's have supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Supper awaits Mr. Non-Committal-Here-As-Ever,&rdquo;
said Mary as she laid her arm in her
husband's and they went toward the dining-room
together.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" title="105"> </a>One evening the doctor and Mary sat chatting
with a neighbor who had dropped in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to use your 'phone a minute, please,&rdquo;
said a voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mary, and Mrs. X. stepped
in, nodded to the trio, walked to the telephone
as one quite accustomed, and rang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want Dr. Brown's office,&rdquo; she said. In a
minute came the hello.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Brown? My little boy is sick.
I want you to come out to see him this evening.
This is Mrs. X. Will you be right <ins title="out?">out?&rdquo;</ins></p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. Good-bye.&rdquo; And she departed.</p>

<p>The eyes of the visitor twinkled. &ldquo;Our
neighbor hath need of two great blessings,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;a telephone and a sense of humor.&rdquo; Mary
laughed merrily, &ldquo;O, we're so used to it we paid
no attention,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I suppose it did
strike you as rather funny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a heap better than it used to be when we
didn't have telephones,&rdquo; said the doctor, with
the hearty laugh that had helped many a downcast
man and woman to look on the bright side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I <ins title="yas">was</ins> a young fellow and first hung
up my shingle it was a surprising thing&mdash;the
number of people who could get along without
me. I used to long for some poor fellow to put
his head in at the door and say he needed me.
At last one dark, rainy night came the quick,
importunate knock of someone after a doctor.
No mistaking that knock. I opened the door and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_106" title="106"> </a>
an elderly woman who lived near me, asked
breathlessly, &lsquo;Mr. Blank, will you do me a great
favor?&rsquo;</p>

<p><ins title="&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;">&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo;</ins> I answered promptly.</p>

<p><ins title="&ldquo;My">&lsquo;My</ins> husband is very sick and I came to see if
you would go down and ask Dr. Smithson to
come and see <ins title="him.&rdquo;">him.&rsquo;</ins> I swallowed my astonishment
and wrath, put on my rubber coat and
went for the doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she had the grace to come in next day,&rdquo;
said Mary, &ldquo;and tell me in much confusion that
she was greatly embarrassed and ashamed. It
had not entered her head until that morning
that my husband was a physician.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; put in the doctor, &ldquo;she had not
taken me seriously; in fact had not taken me at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us about the old man who had you
come in to see if he needed a doctor,&rdquo; said Mary.
The doctor smiled, &ldquo;<em>That</em> was when I didn't
count, too,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This old fellow got sick one day and wanted
to send for old Dr. Brown, but being of a
thrifty turn of mind he didn't want to unless he
had to. He knew me pretty well so he sent for
me to come and see if he <em>needed</em> a doctor. If I
thought he did he'd send for Brown. I chatted
with him awhile and he felt better. Next day
he sent word to me again that he wished I'd stop
as I went by and I did. This kept up several
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_107" title="107"> </a>
days and he got better and better, and finally
got well <em>without</em> any doctor, as he said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The visitor laughed, &ldquo;You doctors could unfold
many a tale&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the telephone would permit,&rdquo; said Mary,
as the doctor answered the old summons, took his
hat and left.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; said Mary one day, &ldquo;I wish you would
disconnect the house from the office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! You're a lot of help to me,&rdquo; protested
the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I heard someone wrangling with central
today because the house answered when it
was the office that was wanted.&rdquo; She laughed.
&ldquo;I know there are people who fancy the doctor's
wife enjoying to the utmost her &lsquo;sweet privilege&rsquo;
of answering the 'phone in her husband's
absence. Poor, innocent souls! If they could
only know the deadly weariness of it all&mdash;but
they can't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I didn't know you felt quite that way
about it, Mary. I suppose I can disconnect it
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you don't see how you can? Never mind,
then. We'll go on, and some sweet day you'll
retire from <ins title="practise">practice</ins>. Then hully-gee! won't I
be free! You didn't choose the right sort of
helpmeet, John. You surely could have selected
one who would enjoy thrusting herself into the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" title="108"> </a>
reluctant confidences of people far more than this
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm resigned to my lot,&rdquo; laughed John, as he
kissed his wife and departed.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this you, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I ever to do with Jane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep her in bed! That's what to do with
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I've got a mighty hard job. She's feeling
so much better, she just <em>will</em> get up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep her down for awhile yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe I can today, but I won't answer
for tomorrow. She says she feels like she can
jump over the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can't, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laughter. &ldquo;I'll do the best I can, Doctor, but
that won't be much. Keeping her in bed is easier
said than done,&rdquo; and the doctor grinned a very
ready assent as he hung up the receiver.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>The doctor's family was seated at dinner.
Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. John rose, napkin in hand,
and went while the clatter of knives and forks
instantly ceased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn't you do as I told you, yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" title="109"> </a>&ldquo;I <em>told</em> you what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, did you put them in hot water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then do it. Do it right away. Have the
water <em>hot</em>, <ins title="now.">now.&rdquo;</ins></p>

<p>He came back and went on with his dinner.
Mary admitted to herself a little curiosity as to
what was to be put into hot water. In a few
minutes the dinner was finished and the doctor
was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet I know what that was,&rdquo; spoke up the
small boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked his sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Diphtheria clothes. There's a family in town
that's got the diphtheria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary was relieved&mdash;not that there should be
diphtheria in town, but that the answer for
which her mind was vaguely groping had probably
been found.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. When the doctor had
answered the summons he told Mary he would
have to go down to a little house at the edge of
town about a mile away. When he came back
an hour later he sat down before the fire with
his wife. &ldquo;I remember a night nineteen years
ago when I was called to that house&mdash;a little
boy was born. I used to see the little fellow occasionally
as he grew up and pity him because he
had no show at all. Tonight I saw him, a great
strapping fellow with a good position and no
bad habits. He'll make it all right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" title="110"> </a>The doctor paused for a moment, then went
on. &ldquo;They didn't pay me then. I remember that.
I mentioned it tonight in the young fellow's
presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, you surely didn't!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. His mother said she guessed
Jake could pay the bill himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary looked at this husband of hers with a
quizzical smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn't it strike you that you are going
pretty far back for your bill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's no good reason why this boy should
not pay the bill if he wants to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not. But I don't believe he
was so keen to get into the world as all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it wouldn't surprise me much if that
young fellow should come into my office one of
these days and offer to settle that old score now
that he knows about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you take it if he does!&rdquo; and Mary left
the room quite unconscious that her pronoun was
without an antecedent.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this you, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect you will have to come out to our
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mary Milton.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_111" title="111"> </a>&ldquo;What's the matter out there, Mrs. Milton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Polly's gone and hurt her shoulder. I guess
she run it into the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was she thrown from a horse or a vehicle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how could she run it into the ground?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Polly Milton can run <em>everything</em> into the
ground!&rdquo; and the tone was exasperation itself.
&ldquo;I come purty near havin' to send for you yesterday,
but I managed to get 'er out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of <em>what</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The clothes-wringer. She caught her stomach
fast between the rollers and nearly took a
piece out of it. Nobody wanted her to turn it
but she would do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what has she done <em>today</em>?&rdquo; asked the
doctor, getting impatient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm plum ashamed to tell ye. She was a-playin'
leap-frog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! I'd like to play it myself once more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you'd be scandalized. Some of the
girls come over to see 'er and the first thing I
knowed they was out in the yard playin' leap-frog
like a passel o' boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's good for 'em,&rdquo; announced the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn't very good for Polly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The shoulder is probably dislocated. I'll be
out in a little while and we'll soon fix it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a great big girl nearly fourteen years old
oughtn't&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's all right. Don't you scold her too
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" title="112"> </a>
much.&rdquo; He laughed as he hung up the receiver,
then ordered his horse brought round and in a
few minutes was on his way to the luckless
maiden.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling&mdash;three rings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you come down to James Curtis's right
away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I guess so. What's the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>James Curtis stated the matter and the doctor
put up the receiver, went to the door and looked
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee-mi-nee! It's as dark as a stack of black
cats,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>In a little while he was off. He had to go
horseback and as the horse he usually rode was
lame he took Billy who was little more than a
colt. Before Mary retired she went to the door
and opened it. It was fearfully dark but John
had said it was only a few miles. His faithful
steed could find the way if he could not. John
always got through somehow. With this comforting
assurance she went to bed. By and by
the 'phone was ringing and she was springing
up and hastening to answer it. To the hurried
inquiry she replied, &ldquo;He is in the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How soon will he be back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at the clock. Nearly three hours
since he left home.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" title="113"> </a>&ldquo;I expected him before this; he will surely
be here soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A message was left for him to come at once
to a certain street and number, and Mary went
back to bed. But she could not sleep. Soon
she was at the 'phone again, asking central to
give her the residence of James Curtis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Mr. Curtis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Dr. Blank there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was, but he started home about an hour
ago. He ought to be there by this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mary, reassured. He
would be home in a little bit then and she went
back to her pillow.</p>

<p>It was well she could not know that
her husband was lost in the woods. The
young horse, not well broken to the roads,
had strayed from the beaten path. The doctor
had first become aware of it when his hat was
brushed off by low branches. He dismounted,
and holding the bridle on one arm, got down on
hands and knees and began feeling about with
both hands in the blackness. It seemed a fruitless
search, but at last he found it and put it securely
on his head. He did not remount, but tried to
find his way back into the path.</p>

<p>After awhile the colt stopped suddenly.
He urged it on. Snap! A big something
was hurled through the bushes and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" title="114"> </a>
landed at the doctor's feet with a heavy
thud. The pommel of the saddle had
caught on a grape vine and the girths had
snapped with the strain. John made a few remarks
while he was picking it up and a few
more while he was getting it on the back of the
shying colt. But he finally landed it and managed
to get it half-fastened. He stood still, not
knowing which way to turn. A dog was barking
somewhere&mdash;he would go in that direction.
Still keeping the bridle over his arm he spread
his hands before him and slowly moved on.</p>

<p>At last he stopped. He seemed to be getting
no nearer to the dog. All at once, and not a
great way off, he saw a fine sight. It was a
lighted doorway with the figure of a man in it.
He shouted lustily,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring a lantern out here, my friend, if you
please. I guess I'm lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the man shouted back and in a
few minutes the lantern was bobbing along
among the trees. &ldquo;Why, Doctor!&rdquo; exclaimed
James Curtis, &ldquo;have you been floundering around
all this time in these woods so close to the house?
Why didn't you holler before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There didn't seem to be anything to &lsquo;holler&rsquo;
at. Until that door opened I thought I was in
the middle of these woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your wife just telephoned to know if you
were at our house and I told her you started
home an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" title="115"> </a>&ldquo;She'll be uneasy. Put me into the main road,
will you, and we'll make tracks for home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he got there and had told Mary about
it, she vowed she would not let him go to the
country again when the night was so pitch dark,
realizing as she made it, the futility of her vow.
Then she told him of the message that had
come in his absence and straightway sent him
out again into the darkness.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>It was midnight. The doctor was snoring so
loudly that he had awakened Mary. Just in
time. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling-ling. By hard work
she got him awake. He floundered out and along
toward the little tyrant. He reached it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O! I got the wrong number.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slumber again. After some time Mary was
awakened by her husband's voice asking, &ldquo;What
is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's time for George to take his medicine.
We've been having a dispute about it. I said it
was the powder he was to take at two o'clock
and he said it was the medicine in the bottle.
Now he's mad and won't take either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the powder. Tell him I say for him
to take it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answering voice sank to a whisper, but
the words came very distinctly, &ldquo;I'm afraid he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" title="116"> </a>
won't do it&mdash;he's so stubborn. I wish it was
the bottle medicine because I believe he would
take that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor chuckled. &ldquo;Give him that,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It won't make a great deal of difference
in this case, and thinking he was in the right will
do him more good than the powder. Good night
and report in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The report in the morning was that George
was better!</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>It was a lovely Sabbath in May. The doctor's
wife had been out on the veranda, looking about
her. Everywhere was bloom and beauty, fragrance
and song. Long she sat in silent contemplation
of the scene. At last a drowsiness
stole over her and she went in and settled herself
for a doze in the big easy chair.</p>

<p>Soon a tinkling fell upon her drowsy ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that must have been the telephone. I
wonder if it was two rings or three&mdash;I'd better
listen,&rdquo; she said with a sigh as she pulled herself
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank?&rdquo; The voice was faint and
indistinct.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; said Mary's husband's voice, with
the rising inflection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; A more pronounced rise. No answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; falling inflection. Here Mary interposed.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" title="117"> </a>&ldquo;It's some lady, Doctor, I heard her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; with a fiercely falling inflection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Blank,&rdquo; said the faint voice, &ldquo;I forgot
how you said to take those red tablets.&rdquo; Mary
caught all the sentence though only the last three
words came distinctly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Her husband's &lsquo;yes&rsquo; was plainly an
interrogation waiting for what was to follow.
She understood. He had heard only the words
&ldquo;those red tablets.&rdquo; Again she must interpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, she says she forgot how you told
her to take those red tablets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O! Why, take one every&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary hung up the receiver and went back to
resume her interrupted nap. She settled back
on the cushions and by and by became oblivious
to all about her. Sweetly she slept for awhile
then started up rubbing her eyes. She went hurriedly
to the 'phone and put the receiver to her
ear. Silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; she said. No answer. Smiling a
little foolishly she went back to her chair. &ldquo;It
isn't surprising that I dreamed it.&rdquo; For a few
minutes she lay looking out into the snow flakes
of the cherry blooms. Then came the bell&mdash;three
rings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it's John asking me to drive to the
country,&rdquo; she thought as she hurried to the
'phone. It was not. It was a woman's voice
asking,</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much of that gargle must I use at a
time?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_118" title="118"> </a>&ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; thought Mary, &ldquo;what questions
people do ask! When a gargler is a-gargling,
I should think she could <em>tell</em> how much to use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor evidently thought so too for he
answered with quick impatience, &ldquo;Aw-enough
to <em>gargle</em> with.&rdquo; Then he added, &ldquo;If it's too
strong weaken it a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much water must I put in it?&rdquo; Mary
sighed hopelessly and stayed to hear no more.
Again she sank back in her chair hoping fervently
that no more foolish questions were to
rouse her from it.</p>

<p>When she was dozing off the bell rang so
sharply she was on her feet and at the 'phone almost
before she knew it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, the whole outfit's drunk again down
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A woman's voice was making the announcement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; The doctor's voice was calm
and undisturbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. The woman's out here in the street just
jumpin' up and down. I think <em>she's</em> about
crazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She hasn't far to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her father's drunk too and so's her husband.
Will you come down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don't think I'll come down this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then will you send an officer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No-o&mdash;I don't&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" title="119"> </a>&ldquo;I wish you <em>would</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I'll try to send someone.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Mary was at last too wide awake to think of
dozing. This blot on the sweet May Sabbath
drove away all thought of day dreams. Poor,
miserable human creatures! Poor, long-suffering
neighbors, and poor John!</p>

<p>&ldquo;All sorts of people appeal to him in all sorts
of cases, and often in cases which do not come
within a doctor's province at all&mdash;he is guide,
counsellor and friend,&rdquo; she thought as she put on
her hat and went out for a walk.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_120" title="120"> </a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p>One Sunday morning at the beginning of August,
Mary stood in the church&mdash;as it chanced,
in the back row&mdash;and sang with her next neighbor
from the same hymn book, John Newton's
good old hymn,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&ldquo;Amazing grace, how sweet the sound<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">That saved a wretch like me!&rdquo;<br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was the opening hymn and they were in
the midst of the third verse.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&ldquo;Thro' many dangers, toils and snares,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">I have already come&rdquo;;<br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">sang Mary.</p>

<p>She did not dream that another danger, toil
and snare was approaching her at that instant
from the rear and so her clear soprano rang out
unfaltering on the next line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&ldquo;'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far&mdash;&rdquo;<br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then a hand was laid upon her shoulder. She
turned and started as she saw her husband's face
bending to her. What had happened at home?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn't you like to go to the country?&rdquo;
whispered the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I don't like to leave church to go,&rdquo;
Mary whispered back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The carriage is right here at the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_121" title="121"> </a>The next instant she had taken her parasol
from behind the hymn-books in front of her,
where she had propped it a few minutes before,
with some misgiving lest it fall to the floor during
prayer, and just as the congregation sang
the last line,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&ldquo;And grace will lead me home,&rdquo;<br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">she glided from the church by the side of the
doctor, thankful that in the bustle of sitting down
the congregation would not notice her departure.
They descended the steps, entered the waiting
carriage and off they sped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel guilty,&rdquo; said Mary, a little dazed over
the swift transfer. The doctor did not reply.
In another minute she turned to him with energy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, what possessed you to come to <em>the
church</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I couldn't get you at home. I drove
around there and Mollie said you had gone to
church so I just drove there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to have gone without me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor smiled. &ldquo;You didn't <em>have</em> to go.
But you are better off out here than sitting in the
church.&rdquo; The horse switched his tail over the
reins and the doctor, failing in his effort to release
them, gave vent to a vigorous expletive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I certainly do hear some things out here
that I wouldn't be apt to hear in there,&rdquo; she said.
Then the reins being released and serenity restored,
they went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn't that a pretty sight?&rdquo; The doctor nodded
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_122" title="122"> </a>
his head toward two little girls in fresh white
dresses who stood on the side-walk anxiously
watching his approach. There was earnest interest
in the blue eyes and the black. Near the
little girls stood a white-headed toddler of about
two years and by his side a boy seven or eight
years old.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Blank,&rdquo; called the blue-eyed little girl&mdash;all
men with or without titles are <em>Mr.</em> to little
folks;&mdash;the doctor stopped his horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it, Mamie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to bring my mamma a baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, a boy baby. Mamie and me wants
a little brother,&rdquo; chimed in the little black-eyed
girl.</p>

<p>The boy looked down at the toddler beside him
and then at the two little girls with weary contempt.
&ldquo;You don't know what you're a-gittin'
into,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If this one hadn't never learned
to walk it wouldn't be so bad, but he jist learns
<em>everything</em> and he jist bothers me <em>all the time</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor and Mary laughed with great enjoyment.
&ldquo;Now! what'd I tell you!&rdquo; said the
boy, as he ran to pick up the toddler who at
that instant fell off the sidewalk. He gave him a
vigorous shake as he set him on his feet and a
roar went up. &ldquo;Don't you <em>git</em> any baby at your
house,&rdquo; he said, warningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, bring us one, Mr. Blank, please do, a
little <em>bit</em> of a one,&rdquo; said Mamie, and the black
eyes pleaded too.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_123" title="123"> </a>&ldquo;Well, I'll tell you. If you'll be good and do
whatever your mamma tells you, maybe I <em>will</em>
find a baby one of these days and if I do I'll
bring it to your house.&rdquo; He drove on.</p>

<p><ins title="If">&ldquo;If</ins> they knew what I know their little hearts
would almost burst for joy. Their father is just
as anxious for a boy as they are, too,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>They were soon out in the open country. It
was one of those lovely days which sometimes
come at this season of the year which seem to
belong to early autumn; neither too warm nor
too cool for comfort. A soft haze lay upon
the landscape and over all the Sunday calm.
They turned into a broad, dusty road. Mary's
eyes wandered across the meadow on the right
with its background of woods in the distance.
A solitary cow stood contentedly in the shade of
a solitary tree, while far above a vulture sailed
on slumbrous wings.</p>

<p>The old rail fence and the blackberry
briars hugging it here and there in clumps;
small clusters of the golden-rod, even now
a pale yellow, which by and by would
glorify all the country lanes; the hazel bushes
laden with their delightful promise for the autumn&mdash;Mary
noted them all. They passed unchallenged
those wayside sentinels, the tall mullein-stalks.
The Venus Looking-Glass nodded its
blue head ever so gently as the brown eyes fell
upon it and then they went a little way ahead
to where the blossoms of the elderberry were
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_124" title="124"> </a>
turning into tiny globules of green. Mary asked
the doctor if he thought the corn in the field
would ever straighten up again. A wind storm
had passed over it and many of the large stalks
were almost flat upon the earth. The doctor answered
cheerfully that the sun would pull it up
again if Aesop wasn't a fraud.</p>

<p>After a while they stopped at a big gate opening
into a field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold the reins, please, till I see if I can get
the combination of that gate,&rdquo; and the doctor
got out. Mary took a rein in each hand as he
opened the gate. She clucked to the horse and
he started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoa! John, come and get my mite. It's
about to slip out of my glove.&rdquo; The doctor
glanced at the coin Mary deposited in his palm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They didn't lose much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The universal collection coin, my dear. Now
open the gate wider and I'll drive through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't hit the gate post!&rdquo; She looked at
him with disdain. &ldquo;I never drove through a
gate in my life that somebody didn't yell, &lsquo;Don't
hit the gate post&rsquo; and yet I never <em>have</em> hit a gate
post.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this retort the doctor had much ado to get
the gate fastened and pull himself into the buggy,
and his laughter had hardly subsided before they
drew up to the large farm house in the field.
Mary did not go in. In about twenty minutes
the doctor came out. The door-step turned, almost
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_125" title="125"> </a>
causing him to fall. &ldquo;Here's a fine chance
for a broken bone and some of you will get it if
you don't fix this step,&rdquo; he growled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll fix that tomorrow,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;but
I should think you'd be the last one to complain
about it, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some people seem to think that doctors and
their wives are filled with mercenary malice,&rdquo;
said Mary laughing. &ldquo;Yesterday I was walking
along with a lady when I stopped to remove a
banana skin from the sidewalk. She said she
would think a doctor's wife wouldn't take the
trouble to remove banana skins from the walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe in preventive medicine,&rdquo; said the
doctor, &ldquo;and mending broken steps and removing
banana peeling belong to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think it will ever be an established
fact?&rdquo; asked Mary as they drove away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do indeed. It will be the medicine of the
future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm glad I'm not a woman of the future, then,
for I really don't want to starve to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to visit a patient a few miles
farther on,&rdquo; said the doctor when they
came out on the highway. Soon they were
driving across a knoll and fields of tasseled
corn lay before them. A little farther
and they entered the woods. &ldquo;Ah, Mary,
I would not worry about leaving church. The
groves were God's first temples.&rdquo; After a little
he said, &ldquo;I was trying to think what Beecher said
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_126" title="126"> </a>
about trees&mdash;it was something like this: &lsquo;Without
doubt better trees there might be than even
the most noble and beautiful now. Perhaps God
has in his thoughts much better ones than he has
ever planted on this globe. They are reserved
for the glorious land.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See this, John!&rdquo; and Mary pointed to a group
of trees they were passing, &ldquo;a ring cut around
every one of them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the fool's idea of things is to go out
and kill a tree by the roadside&mdash;often standing
where it can't possibly do any harm. How often
in my drives I have seen this and it always makes
me mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They drove for a while in silence, then Mary
said, &ldquo;Nature seems partial to gold.&rdquo; She had
been noting the Spanish needles and Black-eyed
Susans which starred the dusty roadside and
filled the field on the left with purest yellow,
while golden-rod and wild sunflowers bloomed
profusely on all sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that seems to be the prevailing color in
the wild-flowers of this region.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That reminds me of something. A few months
ago a little girl said to me, &lsquo;Mrs. Blank, don't
you think red is God's favorite color?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why,
dear, I don't think I ever thought about it,&rsquo; I
answered, quite surprised. &lsquo;Well, I think he
likes <em>red</em> better than any color.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why I don't
know, but when we look around and see the grass
and the trees and the vines growing everywhere,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_127" title="127"> </a>
it seems to me that <em>green</em> might be his favorite
color. But what makes you think it is red?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Because he put <em>blood</em> into everybody in the
world.&rsquo; Quite staggered by this reasoning and
making an effort to keep from smiling, I said,
&lsquo;But we can't see that. If red is his favorite
color why should he put it where it can't be
seen?&rsquo; The child looked at me in amazement.
&lsquo;<em>God</em> can see it. He can see clear <em>through</em> anybody.&rsquo;
The little reasoner had vanquished me
and I fled the field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little way ahead lay a large snake stretched
out across the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy that put it there couldn't help it,&rdquo;
said the doctor, &ldquo;it's born in him. When I was
a lad every snake I killed was promptly brought
to the road and stretched across it to scare the
passers-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet I don't suppose it ever did scare
anyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Occasionally a girl or woman uttered a
shriek and I felt repaid. I remember one big
girl walking along barefooted; before she knew
it she had set her foot on the cold, slimy thing.
The way she yelled and made the dust fly filled
my soul with a frenzy of delight. I rolled over
and over in the weeds by the roadside and yelled
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sudden turn in the road brought the doctor
and his wife face to face with a young man and
his sweetheart. Mary knew at a glance they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_128" title="128"> </a>
were sweethearts. They were emerging into the
highway from a grassy woods-road which led
down to a little church. The young man was
leading two saddled horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you suppose they walk instead of
riding?&rdquo; asked the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! they'll hear you. Isn't she pretty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man assisted his companion to her
seat in the saddle. She started off in one direction,
while he sprang on his horse and galloped
away in the other. &ldquo;Here! you rascal,&rdquo; the doctor
called, as he passed, &ldquo;why didn't you go all
the way with her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll go back tonight,&rdquo; the young fellow called
back, dashing on at so mad a pace that the broad
rim of his hat stood straight up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know them both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After another mile our travelers went down
one long hill and up another and stopped at a
house on the hilltop where lived the patient.
Here, too, Mary chose to remain in the buggy.
A wagon had stopped before a big gate opening
into the barnyard and an old man in it was evidently
waiting for someone. He looked at Mary
and she looked at him; but he did not speak and
just as she was about to say good morning, he
turned and looked in another direction. When
he finally looked around it seemed to Mary it
would be a little awkward to bid him good morning
now, so she tried to think what to say instead,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_129" title="129"> </a>
by way of friendly greeting; it would be
a little embarrassing to sit facing a human being
for some time with not a word to break the constraint.
But the more she cudgeled her brain
the farther away flew every idea. She might ask
him if he thought we were going to have a good
corn crop, but it was so evident that we were,
since the crop was already made that that remark
seemed inane. The silence was beginning to be
oppressive. Her eye wandered over the yard
and she noticed some peach trees near the house
with some of the delicious fruit hanging from
the boughs. She remarked pleasantly, &ldquo;I see
they have some peaches here.&rdquo; Her companion
looked at her and said, &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;I see they have some peaches here,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she rejoined, raising her voice. He curved one
hand around his ear and said again, &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, good gracious,&rdquo; thought Mary, &ldquo;I wish I
had let him alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shrieked this time, &ldquo;I only said, &lsquo;<em>I see they
have some peaches here.</em>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the old man said, &ldquo;I didn't hear ye yet,
mum,&rdquo; she leaned back in the carriage, fanning
herself vigorously, and gave it up. She had
screamed as loud as she intended to scream over
so trivial a matter. Looking toward the house
she saw a tall young girl coming down the walk
with something in her hand. She came timidly
through the little gate and handed a plate of
peaches up to the lady in the carriage, looking
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_130" title="130"> </a>
somewhat frightened as she did so. &ldquo;I didn't
hear ye,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;but Jim came in and
said you was a-wantin' some peaches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary's face was a study. Jim and his sister
had not seen the deaf old man in the wagon, as
a low-branched pine stood between the wagon
and the house. And this was the way her politeness
was interpreted!</p>

<p>The comicality of the situation was too much.
She laughed merrily and explained things to the
tall girl who seemed much relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to 'a' brought a knife, but I was in
such a hurry I forgot it.&rdquo; Eating peaches with
the fuzz on was quite too much for Mary so she
said, &ldquo;Thank you, but we'll be starting home in
a moment, I'll not have time to eat them. But
I am very thirsty, might I have a glass of
water?&rdquo; The girl went up the walk and disappeared
into the house. Mary did so want her
to come out and draw the water, dripping and
cool, from the old well yonder. She came out,
went to the well, stooped and filled the glass from
the bucket sitting inside the curb. Mary sighed.
The tall girl took a step. Then, to the watcher's
delight, she threw the water out, pulled the bucket
up and emptied it into the trough, and one end
of the creaking well-sweep started downward
while the other started upward. The bucket was
on its way to the cool depths and Mary grew
thirstier every second.</p>

<p>The doctor appeared at the door and looked
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_131" title="131"> </a>
out. Then he came, case in hand, with swift
strides down the walk. The gate banged behind
him and he untied the horse in hot haste, looking
savagely at his wife as he did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you've asked that girl to bring you
a drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. I'm very thirsty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to have more sense than to want
to drink where people have typhoid fever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl started down the walk with the brimming
glass. The doctor climbed into the buggy
and turned around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For pity's sake! what will she think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A vigorous cut from the whip and the horse
dashed off down the road. Mary cast a longing,
lingering look behind. The girl stood looking
after them with open mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That girl has had enough today to astonish
her out of a year's growth,&rdquo; thought Mary as
the buggy bumped against a projecting plank and
tore over the bridge at the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, one of the rules of good driving is
never to drive fast down hill.&rdquo; Her spouse answered
never a word.</p>

<p>After a little he said, &ldquo;I didn't mean to be
cross, Mary, but I didn't want you to drink
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have warned me beforehand,
then,&rdquo; she said chillingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn't sit in the buggy and <em>divine</em> there
was typhoid fever there,&rdquo; she continued. <ins title="&ldquo;A">&ldquo;&lsquo;A</ins> woman's
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_132" title="132"> </a>
intuitions are safe guides&rsquo; but she has to
have <em>something</em> to go on before she can <em>have</em> intuitions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hadn't you better put your ulster on, dear?&rdquo;
inquired the doctor in such meaning tones, that
Mary turned quickly and looked off across the
fields. A Black-eyed Susan by the roadside
caught the smile in her eyes and nodded its yellow
head and smiled mischievously back at her.
It was a feminine flower and they understood
each other.</p>

<p>When they had driven three or four miles
Mary asked the doctor if there was any typhoid
fever in the house they were approaching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you might be able to divine whether
there is or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We'll suppose there isn't. We'll stop and get
a drink,&rdquo; he answered indulgently. They stopped,
Mary took the reins and the doctor went to reconnoiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody at home and not a vessel of any
kind in sight,&rdquo; he announced coming back. Of
course her thirst was now raging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe there's a gourd hanging inside the
curb. If there is do break it loose and bring it
to me heaping full.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I looked inside the curb&mdash;nothing there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Mary's anxious eyes saw a glass fruit
jar turned upside down on a fence paling. Blessings
on the woman who put it there! The doctor
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_133" title="133"> </a>
filled and brought it to her. After a long
draught she uttered a sigh of rich content.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I'm ready to go home.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_134" title="134"> </a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's one of 'em,&rdquo; said John, recognizing the
voice of a patient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, doctor, the <em>other</em> side of my throat is
sore <em>now</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it? Well, I told your husband it might be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? Well, because I'm running short of
coffee and a few things like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little laugh. &ldquo;<em>I</em> don't want to keep you in
coffee and things like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody does. But the poor doctors have to
live and you must contribute your share.&rdquo;
Laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Doctor, but I don't want to have to
contribute too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't be alarmed about your throat, Mrs.
Channing. When I looked at it yesterday, I
saw indications that the other side might be affected,
but it will soon be well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds better. Thank you, good-bye.&rdquo;
When he came back to the table his <ins title="wife,">wife</ins> said,
&ldquo;John, I shouldn't think you'd say things like
that to people.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_135" title="135"> </a>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they might believe 'em.&rdquo; The doctor
laughed, swallowed his cup of tea and departed.</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Three times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Dr. Blank at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has just this minute left for the office.
'Phone him there in two minutes and you will
get him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary went back, took two bites and when
the third was suspended on her fork the 'phone
rang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody else,&rdquo; she thought, laying the fork
down and rising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I've got you again, Mrs. Blank. You
said to ring in two minutes and I'd get the
doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you didn't wait <em>one</em> minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seemed lots longer. All right, I'll wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People expect a doctor to get there in less
than no time,&rdquo; thought Mary. &ldquo;John walks so
fast I felt safe in telling her to 'phone him in
two minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Buzz-z-z-z-z</em>, as if all the machinery of the universe
were let loose in her ear. She had held
the receiver till her husband could reach the office
so she might feel assured the anxious one
had found him. Yes, that was his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Blank, you're president of the board of
health, ain't ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;guess so.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_136" title="136"> </a>&ldquo;This is Jack Johnson's. There's a dead horse
down here by our house an' I want you to come
down here an' bury it.&rdquo; Our listener heard the
woman's teeth snap together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. I'll get a spade and come right
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do they take my husband for,&rdquo; thought
Mary.</p>

<p>Buzz-z-z-z at her ear again. Now it was her
husband's voice saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me number forty-five.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a minute a gentlemanly voice said, &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this you, Warner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's a dead horse down by Jack Johnson's.
Go down there and bury it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Doc. I'll be right along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A burst of laughter from the doctor was
echoed by Warner. Mary knew that Warner
was the newly elected alderman and she smiled
as she pictured the new officer leaving his elegant
home and going down to perform the obsequies.
Nevertheless her heart leaned toward
Jack Johnson's wife, for it was plain to be seen
that neither the new president of the board of
health nor the new alderman had a realizing
sense of his duties.</p>

<p>Half an hour later three rings sounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank's office?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, his residence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I see by the paper he's on the board of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_137" title="137"> </a>
health and we want this manure-pile taken away
from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please 'phone your complaints to the doctor,&rdquo;
said Mary, calmly replacing the receiver and
shutting off the flood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John's existence will be made miserable by
this new honor thrust upon him,&rdquo; she thought.</p>

<p>When he came home that evening she asked
if the second complainant had found him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she found me all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They're going to make day hideous and night
lamented, aren't they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, no. I'll just have a little fun and then
send someone to look after their complaints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just before bed-time the doctor was called to
the 'phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, this is the nurse at the hotel. What
had I better do with this Polish girl's hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn't it look all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it's doing fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just let it alone, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She won't be satisfied. She thinks we ought
to be doing something to it. And I've got to
do something or she'll go off upstairs and wash
it in dirty water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell her not to do anything of the kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can't understand a word I say and I
don't know what to do with her. She's had the
bandage off once already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil she has! Well, then you'll have to
unwrap it, I guess, and pretend to do something.
But it would be better to let it alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_138" title="138"> </a>&ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is the other patient tonight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doing fine, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>There was a spacious, airy, upper chamber
opening out on a balcony at the doctor's house
which the doctor and Mary claimed for theirs.
Not now; O no! But in the beautiful golden
sometime when the telephone ceased from troubling
and the weary ones might rest. This meant
when the doctor should retire from night practice.
Until that happy time they occupied a
smaller room on the first floor as it was near the
telephone. Mary had steadfastly refused to have
the privacy of her upper rooms invaded by the
tyrant.</p>

<p>One warm summer night when bed-time came
she made the announcement that she was going
upstairs to sleep in the big room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what if I should be called out in the
night?&rdquo; asked her husband, with protest in his
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I'd be safer up there than down here,&rdquo;
said Mary, calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I mean you couldn't hear the 'phone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a consummation devoutly to be
wished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don't go off up there,&rdquo; expostulated
John. &ldquo;You always hear it and I sort of depend
on you to get me awake.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_139" title="139"> </a>&ldquo;Exactly. But it's a good thing for a man to
depend on himself once in awhile. I was awake
so often last night that I'm too tired and sleepy
to argue. But I'm going. Good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thunder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn't ring <em>every</em> night,&rdquo; said Mary, comfortingly
from the landing. &ldquo;Let us retire in the
fond belief that curfew will not ring tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she retired she fell at once into deep
sleep. For two hours she slept sweetly on.
Then she was instantly aroused. The figure of
a man stood by her side. In the moonlight she
saw him plainly, clad in black. Her heart was
coming up into her throat when a voice said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary, I have to go two miles into the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn't you call me, John, instead of
standing there and scaring me to death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did call you but I couldn't get you awake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you ought to have let me be. If a woman
hasn't a right to a night's sleep once in
awhile what <em>is</em> she entitled to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This petulance was unusual with his wife.
&ldquo;Well, come on down now, Mary,&rdquo; he said,
kindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm not going down there this night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you can't hear the 'phone up here and
I'm expecting a message any minute that must
be answered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll&mdash;hear&mdash;that&mdash;'phone,&rdquo; said Mary.
&ldquo;I'll sleep with one ear and one eye open.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_140" title="140"> </a>&ldquo;Have it your own way,&rdquo; said the doctor as
he started down the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend to. But when I tell you I'll watch
the 'phone, John, you know I'll do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was gone and she lay wide awake. It
seemed very hard to be ruthlessly pulled from
a sleep so deep and delicious and so much
needed.</p>

<p>By and by her eye-lids began to feel heavy and
her thoughts went wandering into queer places.
&ldquo;This won't do,&rdquo; she said aloud, sitting up in
bed. Then she rose and went out on to the balcony.
Seating herself in an arm chair, she
looked about her on the silvery loveliness. The
cricket's chirr and the occasional affirmations of
the katy-did were the only sounds she heard. &ldquo;I
didn't say you didn't. Don't be so spiteful
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The moon, shining through the branches of
the big oak tree made faintly-flickering shadows
at her feet. The white hammock, stirring
occasionally as a breeze touched it, invited her.
She went over to it and lay for many minutes
looking up, noting how fast the moon glided
from one branch of the tree to another. Now
it neared the trunk. Now a slice was cut off its
western rim. Now it was only a half moon&mdash;&ldquo;a
bweak-moon on the sky,&rdquo; as her little boy had
called it. Now there was a total eclipse. When
it began peeping out on the other side of the
trunk our watcher's dreamful eyes took no note
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_141" title="141"> </a>
of it. A dog barked. She sprang up and seated
herself in the chair again. She dare not trust
herself to the hammock. It was too seductive
and too delightful. So she sat erect and waited
for the ring which might not come but which
must be watched for just the same. Her promise
had gone forth. Far up the street she heard
horses' hoofs&mdash;it must be John returning. The
buggy-top shining in the moonlight came into
view. No, it was a white horse. Her vigil was
not yet ended. A quarter of an hour later she
discerned a figure far down the walk. She followed
it with her eyes. It moved swiftly on.
Would it turn at the corner and come up toward
their house? Yes, it was turning. Then it
turned into the yard. It was John. She went
forward and leaning over the railing called down
to him, &ldquo;A good chance to play Romeo now,
John.&rdquo; John only grunted&mdash;after the manner
of husbands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody rang. I'm going to bed again.
Good night&mdash;I mean good morning.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>The next night was hotter than ever and Mary
made up her mind she would sleep up in the hammock.
She had had a delicious taste of it which
made her wish for more. To avoid useless discussion
she would wait till John retired and was
asleep, then she would quietly steal away. But
when this was accomplished and she had settled
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_142" title="142"> </a>
herself comfortably to sleep she found herself
wide awake. She closed her eyes and gently
wooed slumber, but it came not. Ah, now she
knew! The night before she had shaken off all
responsibility for the 'phone. Therefore she
could sleep. Tonight her husband lay unconscious
of her absence and the burden of it was
upon her shoulders again. Well, she must try to
sleep anyway, this was too good a chance to lose.
She fell asleep. After awhile dinner was ready.
Mollie had rung the little bell for the boys. Now
she was ringing it again. Where can the boys
have got to? Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.
Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Mary sat up in
the hammock and rubbed her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she sprang out and rushed to the stairs.
&ldquo;Doctor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John!&rdquo; The snores continued. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; gasped Mary, hurrying down as
fast as her feet could take her. Straight to the
'phone she went. It must be appeased first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hell-<em>o</em><ins title="!&rdquo;">!</ins> Where's the doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is very fast asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've found that out. Can you get him
awake?&rdquo; Sharp impatience was in the man's
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold the 'phone a minute, please, and I'll
rouse him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went into the bedroom and calling, &ldquo;John!
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_143" title="143"> </a>
John!&rdquo; shook him soundly by the shoulders. He
sat up in bed with a wild look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to the 'phone, quick!&rdquo; commanded Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to the <em>'phone</em>. It's been ringing like fury.
Hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last he was there and his wife knew by his
questions and answers that he would be out for
the rest of the night. She crept into bed. After
he was gone she would go upstairs. When he
was dressed he came to the door and peered in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's right, Mary,&rdquo; he said, with such hearty
satisfaction in his tones that she answered cheerfully,
&ldquo;All right&mdash;I'll stay this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when he was gone she turned her face
from the moonlit window and slept till morning,
oblivious to the thieves and murderers that did
not come.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the doctor there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was called out awhile ago; will be back in
perhaps twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Cowan. I only wanted to ask if
my wife could have some lemonade this morning.
She is very thirsty and craves it&mdash;but I can
call again after awhile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How discouraging to the feverish, thirsty wife
to have her husband come back and tell her he
would 'phone again after awhile. And if, after
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_144" title="144"> </a>
waiting, he still failed to find the doctor? Mary
knew the Cowans quite well so she made bold
to say, hastily, &ldquo;I think the doctor would say
<em>yes</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think he would?&rdquo; asked Mr. Cowan,
hopefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he would, but don't let her have too
much, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. Thank you, Mrs. Blank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An uneasy feeling came into Mary's mind and
would not depart as she went about her work.
Really, what right had she to prescribe for a
sick woman even so harmless a thing as lemonade.
How did she know that it was harmless.
Perhaps in this case there was some combination
of symptoms which would make that very thing
the thing the patient ought not to have.</p>

<p>In about fifteen minutes there came a ring&mdash;three.
Mary started guiltily. It sounded like
the doctor's ring. Was he going to reprimand
her? But it was the voice of a friend and it
surprised Mary with this question:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Blank, if you were me would you have
your daughter operated upon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Operated upon for what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For appendicitis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nettie, let me tell you something: if I had
no more sense than to give you advice on such
a question as that, I certainly hope you would
have more sense than to take it. Advice about
a thing with no sort of knowledge of that thing
is as worthless as it is common.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_145" title="145"> </a>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I thought since you are a doctor's
wife you would know about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you draw up a legal will because you
happen to be the wife of a lawyer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No-o, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But me no buts,&rdquo; quoth Mary. &ldquo;We're even
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I've heard it said a doctor's wife knows
even less than many others about ills and their
remedies because she is so used to depending on
her husband that she never has to think of them
herself. I guess I'd better talk to the doctor.
I just thought I'd see what you said first. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My skirts are clear of any advice in that direction,&rdquo;
thought Mary, her mind reverting again
to the lemonade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nettie couldn't have 'phoned me at a more
opportune minute to get the right answer. But
I wonder if John is back. I'll see.&rdquo; She rang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, John, Mr. Cowan 'phoned awhile ago,
and his wife was very thirsty and craved lemonade
and&mdash;don't scold&mdash;I took the liberty of
saying&mdash;it's awful for a thirsty person to have
to wait and wait you know&mdash;and so I said I
thought <em>you</em> would say she might have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you weren't this long about it,&rdquo; laughed
her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it was all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; Much relieved Mary hung up
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_146" title="146"> </a>
the receiver. &ldquo;What needless apprehension assails
us sometimes,&rdquo; she thought, as she went
singing to her broom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the same, I won't prescribe very often.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_147" title="147"> </a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p>It was five o'clock in the morning when the
doctor heard the call and made his way to it. His
wife was roused too and was a passive listener.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down where? I don't understand you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On what street?.... Down near Dyre's? I
don't know any such family.&rdquo; Here Mary called
out, &ldquo;Maybe they mean Dye's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dye's? Yes, I know where that is..... Galliver&mdash;that's
the name is it? Very well, Mrs.
Galliver, I'll be down in a little while.... Yes,
just as soon as I can dress and get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He proceeded to clothe himself very deliberately,
but years of repression had taught Mary
resignation.</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Three rings.</p>

<p>The doctor went with shoe in hand and again
his wife was a listener.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes..... Yes..... I'm just getting ready to
go to see a patient...... It's a hurry call, is it?
All right then, I'll come there first...... Yes,
right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he put up the receiver he said to his wife,
&ldquo;Somebody else was trying to get me then, too,
but couldn't make it.&rdquo; Mary thought it well he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_148" title="148"> </a>
couldn't since her husband was only one and indivisible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he will probably try again after a little,&rdquo;
she thought, &ldquo;and John will be gone and I won't
know just where to find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling. Collar in hand
the doctor went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes..... Who is this?.... Come where?....
Jackson street. Right next to Wilson's mill?....
On which side? I say on which side of Wilson's
mill?.... West? All right, I'll be down there
after awhile...... No, not right away; I have to
make two other visits first, but as soon as I can
get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When at last he was dressed and his hand was
on the door-knob the 'phone called him back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say I needn't come..... Very well. I'll
come if you want me to though, Mrs. Galliver.
I'm just starting now. I have to see another
patient first.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why John,&rdquo; interposed Mary from the bedroom,
&ldquo;She called you first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be about half an hour before I can
get there..... All right, I'll be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Mary remembered that No.&nbsp;2 was the
hurry call and was silent. When the doctor was
gone she fell asleep but only for two minutes.</p>

<p>She went to answer the call. &ldquo;Has the doctor
started yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is on his way.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_149" title="149"> </a>&ldquo;All right then,&rdquo; and the relief in the tone was
a pleasant thing to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, if I go to sleep again I can feel no security
from No.&nbsp;1 or No.&nbsp;3 or both.&rdquo; Nevertheless
she did go to sleep and neither No.&nbsp;1 nor
No.&nbsp;3 called her out of it.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>&ldquo;I must be going,&rdquo; said Mary, rising from her
chair in a neighbor's house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you something special on hand?&rdquo; asked
her neighbor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it's clock-winding day at our house, for
one thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how many clocks do you have to wind?&rdquo;
inquired the little old lady with mild surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one, thank heaven!&rdquo; ejaculated Mary
as she departed.</p>

<p>When she had sped across the yard and entered
her own door she threw off her shawl and
made ready to wind the clock. First, she turned
off the gas in the grate so that her skirts would
not catch fire. Second, she brought a chair and
set it on the hearth in front of the grate. Third,
she went into the next room and got the big unabridged
dictionary, brought it out and put it on
the chair. Fourth, she went back and got the
oldest and thickest Family Bible and the fat Bible
Dictionary, brought them out and deposited
them on the unabridged. Fifth, she mounted the
chair. Sixth, she mounted the volumes&mdash;which
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_150" title="150"> </a>
brought her up to the height she was seeking to
attain. Seventh, she wound the clock; that is,
she usually did. Today, when she had inserted
the key and turned it twice round&mdash;the 'phone
rang. Oh, dear! Thank goodness it stopped at
two rings. She would take it for granted the
doctor was in the office. She wound on. Then
she took the key out and inserted it on the opposite
side. A second peal. That settled it. If
it were a lawyer's or a merchant's or any other
man's 'phone she could wind the other side first&mdash;but
the doctor's is in the imperative mood and
the present tense. She must descend. Slowly
and cautiously she did so, went to the 'phone and
put the receiver to her ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, is this Dr. Blank's office?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is his&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, what is it?&rdquo; said her husband's voice.
&ldquo;Now why couldn't he have come a minute
sooner,&rdquo; thought Mary, provoked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said an agitated voice, &ldquo;my little
boy has swallowed a penny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it a good one?&rdquo; inquired the doctor,
calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;ye-es,&rdquo; said the voice, broken with a
laugh, &ldquo;guess it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just let him alone. It will be all right after
awhile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was worth getting down to hear so comforting
an assurance,&rdquo; said Mary as she ascended
again the chair and the volumes. She finished
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_151" title="151"> </a>
her weekly task, then slowly and cautiously descended,
carried the big books back to their
places, set the chair in its corner and lighted the
gas. She stood for a moment looking up at this
clock. The space over the mantel-piece was just
the place for it and it was only after it had been
firmly anchored to the wall that the thought had
arisen, &ldquo;How can I ever get up there to wind it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled as she thought of a social gathering
a few days before, when a lady had called to
her across the room, &ldquo;Mrs. Blank, tell us that
clock story again.&rdquo; And she had answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn't much of a story, but it serves to show
the manner in which we computed the time. One
night the doctor woke me up. &lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; he said
in a helpless sort of way, &lsquo;It struck <em>seven</em>&mdash;what
<em>time</em> is it?&rsquo; &lsquo;Well&mdash;let me see,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;If it
struck seven it meant to strike three, for it strikes
four ahead of time. And if it meant to strike
three it's just a quarter past two, for it's three
quarters of an hour too fast.&rsquo;&rdquo; Ting-a-ling-ling.
Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>Mary recognized her husband's ring. &ldquo;Yes,
what is it John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm going out for twenty minutes, watch the
'phone, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed in answer to this most superfluous
request, then sat her down near by.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>&ldquo;John, Mrs. B. said a pretty good thing last
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_152" title="152"> </a>&ldquo;That's good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've a notion not to tell you, now that the
good thing was about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's better still. But are good things about
me so rare that you made a note of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know but what they are,&rdquo; said Mary,
reflectively. &ldquo;There was Mrs. C., you know, who
said she didn't see how in the world Doc Blank's
wife ever lived with him&mdash;he was so mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder about that myself, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The way I manage it is to assert myself when
it becomes necessary&mdash;and it does. You're a
physician to your patients but to me you're a
mere man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel myself shrivelling. But how about Mrs.
B.'s compliment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was over at the church where a social program
of some sort was being given and &lsquo;between
acts&rsquo; everybody was moving about chatting. An
elderly woman near me asked, &lsquo;Mrs. Blank, do
you know who the Hammell's are?&rsquo; I told her
that I did not, and she went on, &lsquo;I see by the
paper that a member of their family died today,
and I thought you, being a doctor's wife, might
know something about it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. B. spoke up promptly, &lsquo;Why, Mrs. Blank
wouldn't know anything about the <em>dead</em> people&mdash;her
husband gets 'em <em>well</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor laughed, &ldquo;And she believes it too,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it. So a compliment like that
offsets one of Mrs. C.'s kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_153" title="153"> </a>&ldquo;O, no. The C.'s have it by a big majority.
Don't you know I have the reputation of being
the meanest man in the county?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have. Do you remember that drive
we took a week or two ago up north?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That long drive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. When I went in the man who was a
stranger to me, said, <ins title="&ldquo;I'll">&lsquo;I'll</ins> tell you why I sent for
you. I've had two or three doctors out here,
recommended as <em>good</em> doctors, and they haven't
done me a darned bit of good. Yesterday I
heard you was the meanest doctor in this county
and I said to myself, &ldquo;He's the man I <ins title="want.&rdquo;">want.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</ins></p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard you laughing and wondered what it
was about. The man's wife came out to the
buggy and talked to me. She said they were
strangers and didn't know anything about the
doctors around here&mdash;they had thought of sending
down to this town for a doctor but she had
spoken to a woman&mdash;a neighbor&mdash;and she had
said there wasn't <em>any</em> of 'em any account down
there. But her husband kept getting worse so
they finally sent for Dr. Blank and she hoped
he'd cure 'im. Are you doing it? I hope so
for I assured her that the physicians of this town
are recognized throughout the State as being
men of exceptional ability, and she went in,
comforted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he got better as soon as he struck the
road to health,&rdquo; laughed John. He took out his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_154" title="154"> </a>
watch. &ldquo;Jove! I haven't any time to spare if I
catch that train.&rdquo; For several days he had been
taking the train to a little station some miles out
of town, where he would get off and walk a mile
to the home of his patient, make his visit and
walk back in time to catch the train for home.</p>

<p>Just after the doctor left the house the telephone
rang twice. His wife answered it, knowing
he had not yet reached the office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the doctor there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He left the house just a minute ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he's coming down today isn't he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Mrs. Shortridge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he just said he must make that train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He'll go to the office first won't he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, to get his case, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please telephone him there to bring
a roast with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To bring what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A roast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary was nonplussed. Her husband had the
reputation of &ldquo;roasting&rdquo; his patients and their
attendants on occasion. Had an occasion arisen
now?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, ye-es,&rdquo; she began, uncertainly, when the
voice spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean a roast of beef, Mrs. Blank. I
thought as the doctor was coming he wouldn't
mind stopping at the butcher's and bringing me
a roast&mdash;tell him a good-sized one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_155" title="155"> </a>The receiver clicked. Mary still held hers.
Then she rang the office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <em>is</em> it?&rdquo; Great haste spoke in the voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, Mrs. Shortridge wants you to bring her
a roast of beef when you go down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil she does!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The market is right on your way. Hurry.
Don't miss the train!&rdquo; She put up the receiver,
then she snatched it and rang again violently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Now</em> what!&rdquo; thundered John's voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said to get a good-sized one.&rdquo; Standing
with the receiver in her hand and shaking with
laughter she heard the office-door shut with a
bang and knew that he was off.</p>

<p>She knew that if he had been going in the
buggy he would have been glad to do Mrs. S.'s
bidding. He often carried ice and other needful
things to homes where he visited. Mary pictured
her husband picking his way along a muddy
country road, his case in one hand and the
&ldquo;roast&rdquo; in the other, and thought within herself,
&ldquo;He'll be in a better mood for a roast when he
arrives than when he started.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Mary was out in the kitchen making jelly. At
the critical moment when the beaded bubbles
were &ldquo;winking at the brim&rdquo; came the ring. She
lifted the kettle to one side, wiped her hands and
went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this you, Mary?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_156" title="156"> </a>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch the 'phone a little bit, please. I have
to be out about half an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm always watching the 'phone, John, always,
<em>always</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went back to her jelly. She put it back
on the fire, an inert mass with all the bubbles
died out of it. Scarcely had she done so when
the 'phone rang&mdash;two rings. Surely the doctor
had not got beyond hearing distance. He would
answer. But perhaps he had&mdash;he was a very
swift walker. The only way to be sure of it
was to go to the telephone and listen. She went
hastily back and as she put the receiver to her
ear there came a buzz against it which made
her jump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted the doctor, Mrs. Blank, do you know
where he is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He just 'phoned me that he&mdash;&rdquo; an unmistakable
sound arose from the kitchen stove. The
jelly was boiling over! Instinct is older than the
telephone. The receiver dangled in air while
Mary rushed madly to the rescue. &ldquo;I might have
known it,&rdquo; she said to herself, as she pushed the
kettle aside and rushed back to the 'phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess they cut us off,&rdquo; said the voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just saying,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;that the doctor
'phoned me a few minutes ago he would be
out for half an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please tell him when he comes in
to call up 83?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_157" title="157"> </a>The man goes on his way, relieved of further
responsibility in the matter. It will be a very
easy thing for the doctor's wife to call up her
husband and give him the message. Let us see.</p>

<p>When the jelly was done, and Mary had begun
to fill the waiting glasses she thought, &ldquo;I'd better
see if John is back. He may go out again before
I can deliver that message.&rdquo; So she set the kettle
on the back of the stove and went to ascertain
if her husband had returned. No answer to her
ring. She had better ring again to be sure of it.
No answer. She went back to the kitchen. When
the glasses were all filled and she had held first
one and then another up to get the sunlight
through the clear beautiful redness of them, she
began setting them back to cool. The telephone!
She hurried in and rang again to see if John had
got back. Silence. She sighed and hung up the
receiver. &ldquo;I'd like to get it off my mind.&rdquo; As
she started toward the kitchen again the door-bell
rang. She went to open the door, and wonder
of wonders&mdash;an old friend she had not seen
for years!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am passing through town, Mary, and have
just three quarters of an hour till my train goes.
Now sit down and <em>talk</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the pair of them did talk, oblivious to
everything about them. How the minutes did
fly and the questions too! The 'phone rang in
the next room&mdash;two rings. On Mary's accustomed
ear it fell unheeded. She talked on. Again
two rings. She did not notice.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_158" title="158"> </a>&ldquo;Isn't that your 'phone?&rdquo; asked the visitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, <em>yes</em>! You knocked it clean out of my
head, Alice. Excuse me a minute,&rdquo; and she vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you give that message to the doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not back yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw him go into the office not ten minutes
ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have 'phoned twice and failed to find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hoped when I saw him leave the office that
he had started down to see my little boy, but of
course he hasn't if he didn't get the message.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry. An old friend I had not seen for
years came in and of course it went out of my
mind for a few minutes, though I 'phoned twice
before she came. I am sure he will be back in
a few minutes and I will send him right down,
Mr. Nelson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you do that?&rdquo; asked her friend,
pointedly as she came in. &ldquo;Why take upon yourself
the responsibility of people's messages being
delivered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> an awful responsibility. I don't know
why I do it&mdash;so many people seem to expect it
as a matter of course&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a great deal easier for each person to deliver
his own message than for you to have a
half dozen on your mind at once. I wouldn't do
it. You'll be a raving lunatic by the next time
I see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least I'll have ample time in which to become
one,&rdquo; laughed Mary.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_159" title="159"> </a>&ldquo;I'm going,&rdquo; announced her friend, suddenly
rising. &ldquo;I could spare five or ten minutes more
but if I sit here you'll forget that 'phone again.
But take my advice, Mary, and institute a change
in the order of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she had gone Mary sat for a few minutes
lost in thought. Then, remembering, she
sprang up and went to the 'phone. No answer
to her ring. &ldquo;Dear me! Will I <em>never</em> get that
message delivered and off my mind.&rdquo; Soon a
ring came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn't he back <em>yet</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I 'phoned about three minutes ago and failed
to get him. By the way, Mr. Nelson, will you
just 'phone the doctor at the office, please? That
will be a more direct way to get him as I seem
to fail altogether this morning. I am sure that
he can't be gone much longer,&rdquo; she said very
pleasantly and hung up the receiver. The responsibility
had been gracefully shifted and she
was free for a while. Other occasions would
arise when she could not be free, but in cases of
this kind her friend's clear insight had helped
her out.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My husband has just started for your office.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_160" title="160"> </a>
He says he's going to send you down. I don't
need a doctor. Will you tell him that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll tell him you <em>said</em> so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't. So don't you come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. I haven't got time to be bothered
with you anyway. The sick people take my
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few minutes the 'phone rang again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Blank, can you come over to the Woolson
Hotel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you can. There's a case here I've
treated a little that I'm not satisfied about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Doctor, I'll be there in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he reached the hotel and had examined
the patient he said, &ldquo;He has smallpox.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I began to suspect that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of doubt of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hotel is full of people&mdash;I'm afraid
there'll be a panic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must get him out of here. We'll have
to improvise a pest-house at once. I'll go and
see about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That evening about an hour after supper the
doctor's daughter came hurriedly into the room
where her mother was sitting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;there's an awful lot
of people in the office, a regular mob and they're
as mad as fury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo; exclaimed her mother, startled.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_161" title="161"> </a>&ldquo;They're mad at father for putting the tent for
a smallpox patient down in their neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he in the office now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was there when I first went in but he
isn't there just now. Father wasn't a bit disturbed,
but I am. I got out of there. The mayor
went into the office just as I came out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uneasy, in spite of herself, Mary waited her
husband's return. Ten o'clock, and he had not
come. She went to the 'phone and called the
office. The office man answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was in here a few minutes ago, but
there's a big fuss down at the smallpox tent and
I think he's gone down there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary rang off and with nervous haste called
the mayor's residence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Mr. Felton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mrs. Blank. I am very uneasy about
the doctor, Mr. Felton. I hear he has just started
down to the smallpox tent. Won't you please
see that someone goes down at once?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Blank. I came from there a little
while ago but they're mad at the doctor and I'll
go right back. I'm not going to bed until I
know everything's quieted down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you'll take others with you?&rdquo; she pleaded,
but the mayor was gone. Again she waited in
great anxiety. The tent was too far away for
her to go out into the night in search of him.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_162" title="162"> </a>Between eleven and twelve o'clock she heard
footsteps. She rose and went to the door. Almost
she expected to see her husband brought
home on a stretcher. But there he came, walking
with buoyant step. When he came in he kissed
his anxious wife and then broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! how good that sounds! I heard of the
mob and have been frightened out of my wits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They've quieted down now. There wasn't a
bit of sense in what they did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't know that one can really blame
them for not wanting smallpox brought into the
neighborhood. Couldn't you have taken the tent
farther out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if we had had time. But we had a sick
man on our hands&mdash;he had to be got out of the
hotel and he had to be taken care of right away.
He had to have a nurse. There must be water
in the tent and the nurse can't be running out
of a pest-house to get it. Neither can anyone
carry it to such a place. So we couldn't put it
beyond the water- and gas-pipes&mdash;there must be
heat, too, you know. We have done the very
best we could without more time. The nearest
house is fifty yards away and there's absolutely
no danger if the people down there will just
get vaccinated and then keep away from the
tent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They surely will do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of them may. One fool said to me
awhile ago when I told them that, &lsquo;Oh, yes! we
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_163" title="163"> </a>
see your game. You want to get a lot of money
out of us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say to that ancient charge,&rdquo;
asked Mary, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;My man, I'll pay for the virus, and
I'll vaccinate everyone of you, and everyone in
that neighborhood and it won't cost you a cent&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he look ashamed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't wait to see. I had urgent business
out just then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the patient in the tent now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, all snug and comfortable with a nurse
to take care of him. That was my urgent business.
I went into the back room of the office in
the midst of their jabber, slipped out the door,
got into the buggy hitched back there, drove to
the hotel and with Dr. Collins' help, got the patient
down the ladder waiting for us, into the
buggy, then got the nurse down the ladder and
in, too, then away we drove lickety-cut for the
tent while the mob was away from there. Then
I went back to the office and attended the meeting,&rdquo;
added the doctor, laughing heartily.</p>

<p>His wife laughed too, but rather uneasily.
&ldquo;Were they still there when you got back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every mother's son of 'em. They didn't stay
long though. I advised them to go home, that
the patient was in the tent and would stay there.
They broke for the tent&mdash;vowed they'd set fire
to it with him in it and I think they intended to
hang <em>me</em>,&rdquo; and the doctor laughed again.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_164" title="164"> </a>&ldquo;John, don't <em>ever</em> get into such a scrape again.
I 'phoned Mr. Felton and begged him to go down
there and take someone with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did? Well, he came, and it happened
there was a member of the State Board of Health
in town who had got on to the racket. He came,
too, and you ought to have heard him read the
riot act to those fellows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We've got a sick man here&mdash;a stranger,
far from his home. You are in no danger whatever.
Every doctor in town has told you so.
We're going to take care of this man <em>and don't
you forget it</em>. We have the whole State of Illinois
behind us, and if this damned foolishness
don't stop right here, I'll have the militia here in
a few hours' time and arrest every one of you.&rsquo;
That quieted them. They slunk off home and
won't bother us any more.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Three or four days after the above conversation
Mary stood at the window looking out at the
storm which was raging. The wind was blowing
fearfully and the rain coming down in torrents.
&ldquo;I do hope John will not be called to the
country today,&rdquo; she thought.</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling&mdash;three rings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank's office?&rdquo; asked a feminine
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, his residence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Blank, this is the nurse at the smallpox
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_165" title="165"> </a>
tent. Will you 'phone the office and tell the doctor
it's raining in down here terribly. I'm in a
hurry, must spread things over the patient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, I'll 'phone him,&rdquo; and she rang
twice. No reply. Again. No reply. &ldquo;Too bad
he isn't in. I'll have to wait a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In five minutes she rang again, but got no reply.
In another minute she was called to the
'phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn't you get word to the doctor, Mrs.
Blank?&rdquo; asked a voice, full of anxiety. &ldquo;I'm
afraid we'll drown before he gets here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been anxiously watching for him, but
he must be visiting a patient. Hold the 'phone
please till I ring again.&rdquo; This time her husband
answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, here's the nurse at the tent to speak
to you.&rdquo; She waited to hear what he would say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, please come down here and help us.
The roof is leaking awfully and we are about to
drown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I'll be down after a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't wait too long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary's practised ear caught something beginning
with a capital D as the receiver clicked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old John,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;it's awful&mdash;the
things you have to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor got into his rubber coat and set
out for his improvised pest-house.</p>

<p>When he came home Mary asked, &ldquo;Did you
stop the leak?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_166" title="166"> </a>&ldquo;I did. But I had a devil of a time doing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm curious to know how you would go
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The roof was double and I had to straighten
out and stretch the upper canvas with the wind
blowing it out of my hands and nobody to help
me hold it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there nobody in sight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That infernal coward of a watchman, but I
couldn't get him near the tent&mdash;he's <em>had</em> smallpox,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think the nurse could have helped a
little, that is if she knew where to take hold of
it, and what to do with it when she got hold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, she sputtered around some and imagined
she was helping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor thing,&rdquo; said Mary, laughing, &ldquo;I know
just how bewildered she was with you storming
commands at her which she couldn't understand&mdash;women
can't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.
Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>The doctor helloed gruffly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this you, Doc?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want ye to come down here an' diagnosis
these cases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>What</em> cases!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's two down here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down <em>where</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down here at my house.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_167" title="167"> </a>&ldquo;Well, who the devil <em>are</em> you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bill Masters. We're afraid maybe it's smallpox.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, <em>yes</em>!&rdquo; snarled the doctor, &ldquo;every <em>pimple</em>
around here for the next three months will be
smallpox.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we want ye to diagnosis it, Doc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. I'll &lsquo;diagnosis&rsquo; it the first time I'm
down that way&mdash;maybe this evening or tomorrow,&rdquo;
and he slammed the receiver up and went
to bed.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>One evening the doctor was waiting for the
stork at a farmhouse some miles from home. He
concluded to telephone his wife as it might be
several hours before he got in. He rang and
put the receiver to his ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you put your washin' out today?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I thought it looked too rainy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So did I. I hope it'll clear up by mornin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got your baby to sleep yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Land! yes. He goes to sleep right after
supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine's not that kind of a kid. He's wider
awake than any of us this minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got your dress cut out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, maybe I'll git around to it tomorrow afternoon,
if I don't have forty other things to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did ye hear about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_168" title="168"> </a>Seeing no chance to get in the doctor retreated.
Half an hour later he rang again. A
giggle and a loud girlish voice in his ear asking,
&ldquo;Is this you, Nettie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know who this is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Course I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bet ye don't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bet I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's Mollie, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You've guessed it. I tried to change my voice
so you wouldn't know me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What fer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, cat-fur to make kitten breeches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mild laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard that you gave Jake the mitten last
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a little bird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say! Who <em>did</em> tell ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'll never, never tell if I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clock near the patiently waiting doctor
struck nine quick short strokes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo; asked the first voice,
startled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose clock <em>is</em> that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnson's haven't got one like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miller's haven't neither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll tell you&mdash;it's Gray's&mdash;their clock strikes
quick like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_169" title="169"> </a>&ldquo;Then there's somebody at their 'phone listenin'!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness! Maybe it's Jake, just like him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jake Gray, if that's you, you're a mean eavesdroppin'
sneak an' that's what I think of <em>you</em>!
Good-bye, Nettie.&rdquo; And as the receiver slammed
into its place the doctor shook with laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This seems to be my opportunity,&rdquo; he
thought, then rang and delivered the message to
his wife. Often these dialogues kept him from
hearing or delivering some important message
and then he fumed inwardly, but tonight he had
time to spare and to laugh.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>After a little the 'phone rang. &ldquo;It's someone
wanting you, Doctor,&rdquo; said the man of the house
who answered it. The doctor went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this you, Doctor Blank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor heard no more. This was a party
line and every receiver on it came down. A
dozen people were listening to find out who
wanted the doctor and what for. All on the line
knew that Doctor Blank had been at the Gray
farmhouse for hours. The message being private,
there was silence. The doctor waited a
minute then his wrath burst forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn it! Hang up your receivers, all you
eavesdroppers, so I can get this message!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_170" title="170"> </a>Click, click, click, click, and lots of people
mad, but the doctor got the message.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Mrs. Blank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I telephoned the office and couldn't get the
doctor so I'll tell you what I wanted and you can
tell him. His patient down here in the country,
Mrs. Miller, is out of powders and she wants him
to send some down by Mrs. Richards, if he can
find her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Mrs. Richards?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's up there in town somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she know that the powders are to be
sent by her and will she call at the office?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don't think she knows anything about
it. Mrs. Miller didn't know she was out till after
she left. That's all,&rdquo; and she was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All!&rdquo; echoed Mary.</p>

<p>In a few minutes when she thought her husband
had had time to return she went to the
'phone and told him he must go out and hunt up
Mrs. Richards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because Mrs. Miller wants you to find her
and send some powders down by her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An explosion came and Mary retired laughing
and marvelling to what strange uses telephones&mdash;and
doctors&mdash;are put.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_171" title="171"> </a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p>It was a lovely morning in late September.
The sun almost shone through the film of light
gray clouds which lay serenely over all the heavens.
There was a golden gleam in the atmosphere,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&ldquo;And a tender touch upon everything<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">As if Autumn remembered the days of Spring.&rdquo;<br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The doctor and his wife were keenly alive to
the beauty of the day. After they had driven
several miles they stopped before a little brown
house. The doctor said he would like Mary to
go in and she followed him into the low-ceiled
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, you youngsters, go out into the yard,&rdquo;
said the mother of the children. &ldquo;There ain't
room to turn around when you all get in.&rdquo; They
went. A baby seven or eight months old sat on
the floor and stared up at Mary as she seated
herself near it. Two women of the neighborhood
sat solemnly near by. The doctor approached
the bed on which a young woman of
eighteen or twenty years was lying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My heart hain't beat for five minutes,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; said the doctor, quite calm in the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_172" title="172"> </a>
face of an announcement so startling. &ldquo;Well,
we'll have to start it up again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's the first time she has spoke since yesterday
morning,&rdquo; said one of the solemn women
in a low tone to the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It didn't hurt her to keep still. She could
have spoken if she had wanted to.&rdquo; The two
women looked at each other. &ldquo;No, she couldn't
speak, Doctor,&rdquo; said one of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes she could,&rdquo; replied the doctor with
great nonchalance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>couldn't</em>!&rdquo; said the patient with much vigor.
This was just what he wanted. He examined
her carefully but said not a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long do you think I'll live?&rdquo; she asked
after a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that's a hard question to answer&mdash;but
you ought to be good for forty or fifty years yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The patient sniffed contemptuously. &ldquo;Huh, I
guess you don't know it all if you <em>are</em> a doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know enough to know there's mighty little
the matter with <em>you</em>.&rdquo; He turned to one of the
women. &ldquo;I would like to see her mother,&rdquo; he
said. The mother had left the room on an errand;
the woman rose and went out. There was
a pause which Mary broke by asking the baby's
name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We think we'll call her Orient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not Occident?&rdquo; thought Mary, but she
kept still. Not so the doctor. &ldquo;<em>That's</em> no name.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_173" title="173"> </a>
Give her a good sensible <em>name</em>&mdash;one she won't
be ashamed of when she's a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Mary caught sight of a red string around
the baby's neck, and asked if it was a charm of
some sort. The mother took hold of the string
and drew up the charm. &ldquo;It's a blind hog's
tooth,&rdquo; she said simply, &ldquo;to make her cut her
teeth easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother of the patient came into the room.
&ldquo;How do you think she is, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she's not so sick as you thought she was,
not near.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother looked relieved. &ldquo;She had an awful
bad spell last night. Do you think she won't
have any more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she won't have any more.&rdquo; The look on
the patient's face said plainly, &ldquo;We'll see about
that.&rdquo; It did not escape the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in case you should see any signs of a
spell coming on, and if she gets so she can't
speak again, then you must&mdash;but come into the
next room,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>They went into an adjoining room, the doctor
taking care to leave the door ajar. Then in a
voice ostensibly low enough that the patient
might not hear and yet so distinct that she
could hear every word, he delivered his instructions:
&ldquo;Now, if she has any more spells she
must be blistered all the way from her neck down
to the end of her spine.&rdquo; The mother looked
terrified. &ldquo;And if she gets so she can't speak
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_174" title="174"> </a>
again, it will be necessary to put a seton through
the back of her neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <em>is</em> a seton?&rdquo; faltered the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it's nothing but a big needle six or eight
inches long, threaded with coarse cord. It must
be drawn through the flesh and left there for a
while.&rdquo; Then in a tone so low that only the
mother could hear, he said, &ldquo;Don't pay much attention
to her. She'll never have those spells unless
there is somebody around to see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked into the other room and took up
his hat and case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left some powders on the table,&rdquo; he said to
the mother. &ldquo;You may give her one just before
dinner and another tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it make any difference if she doesn't
take it till tonight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pa's gone and I didn't 'low to git any dinner
today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this announcement Mary heard something
between a sigh and a groan and turning, saw a
rosy-cheeked boy in the doorway. There was a
look of resigned despair on his face and Mary
smiled sympathetically at him as she went out.
How many lads and lassies could have sympathized
with him too, having been victims to that
widespread feeling among housewives that when
&ldquo;Pa&rdquo; is gone no dinner need be got and sometimes
not much supper.</p>

<p>As the doctor and his wife started down the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_175" title="175"> </a>
walk they heard a voice say, &ldquo;Ma, don't you ever
send for that smart-aleck doctor agin. I won't
<em>have</em> him.&rdquo; The doctor shook with laughter
as he untied the horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won't need to send for me &lsquo;agin.&rsquo; I
like to get hold of a fine case of hysterics once
in a while&mdash;it makes things lively.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The treatment you prescribed was certainly
heroic enough,&rdquo; said Mary.</p>

<p>They had driven about a mile, when, in passing
a house a young man signaled the doctor to
stop. &ldquo;Mother has been bleeding at the nose a
good deal,&rdquo; he said, coming down to the gate.
&ldquo;I wish you would stop and see her. She'll be
glad to see you, too, Mrs. Blank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were met at the door by a little old woman
in a rather short dress and in rather large
ear-rings. Her husband, two grown daughters
and three children sat and stood in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you've been bleeding at the nose, Mrs.
Haig?&rdquo; said the doctor, looking at his patient
who now sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, and it's a-gittin' me down. I've
been in bed part of the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's been bleedin' off and on for two days
and nights,&rdquo; said the husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you try pretty hard to stop it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I tried everything I ever heerd tell
of, and everything the neighbors wanted me to
try, but it didn't do no good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open the door and sit here where I can have
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_176" title="176"> </a>
a good light to examine your nose by,&rdquo; the doctor
said to the patient. She brought her chair
and the young man opened the door. As he did
so there was a mad rush between the old man
and his two daughters for the door opposite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shet that door, quick!&rdquo; the old man shouted,
and it was instantly done. Mary looked around
with frightened eyes. Had some wild beast escaped
from a passing menagerie and was it coming
in to devour the household? There was a
swirl of ashes and sparks from the big fireplace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the blamedest house that ever was
built,&rdquo; said Mr. Haig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who built it?&rdquo; queried the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I built it myself and like a derned fool went
an' put the fireplace right between these two
outside doors, so if you open one an' the other
happens to be open the fire and ashes just flies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor took an instrument from his pocket
and proceeded with his examination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there's a house back here on the hill
about a mile that beats this,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a queer-looking house,&rdquo; said Mary.
&ldquo;It has no front door at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No side door, neither. When a feller wants
to get in <em>that</em> house there's just one of three
ways: he has to go around and through the
kitchen, or through a winder, or down the
chimney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he was little enough he might go through
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_177" title="177"> </a>
the cat-hole,&rdquo; suggested the young man, at which
they all laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what may that be?&rdquo; asked the mystified
Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a square hole cut in the bottom of the
door for the cat to go in and out at. The man
that owns the place said he believed in having
things handy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, let me see your throat,&rdquo; said the doctor.
The patient opened her mouth to such an
amazing extent that the doctor said, &ldquo;No, I will
stand on the outside!&rdquo; which made Mary
ashamed of him, but the old couple laughed heartily.
They had known this doctor a good many
years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you been doing to stop the bleeding?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've been a-tryin' charms and conjurin',
mostly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary saw that there was no smile on her face
or on any other face in the room. She spoke in
a sincere and matter-of-fact way. &ldquo;Old Uncle
Peter, down here a piece, has cured many a case
of nose-bleed but he hain't 'peared to help mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does he go about it?&rdquo; asked Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;W'y, don't you know nothin' 'bout conjurin'?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you bein' a doctor's wife would
know things like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_178" title="178"> </a>&ldquo;I don't believe my husband practises conjuring
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Uncle Peter takes the Bible, and opens
it, and says some words over it, and pretty soon
the bleedin' stops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which stops it, the Bible or the words?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;W'y&mdash;both I reckon, but the words does the
most of it. They're the charm and nobody
knows 'em but him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did he learn them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His father was a conjurer and when he died
he tol' the words to Uncle Peter an' give the
power to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he come up here to conjure you?&rdquo; asked
the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he says he can do it just as well at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can. But I think we can stop the bleeding
without bothering Uncle Peter any more. I'd
like a pair of scissors,&rdquo; he said, meaning to cut
some papers for powders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won't do no good. I've tried 'em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think I want with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I 'lowed you wanted to put 'em under the
piller. That'll cure nose-bleed lots of times.
Maybe you don't believe it, but it's so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can Uncle Peter cure other things?&rdquo; asked
Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can <em>that</em>. My nephew had the chills last
year and shook and shook. At last he went to
Uncle Peter an' he cured <em>him</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He shot 'em,&rdquo; said Mr. Haig.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_179" title="179"> </a>&ldquo;Yes, he told him to take sixteen shot every
mornin' for sixteen days and by the time he got
through he didn't shake a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By jings! he was so heavy he couldn't,&rdquo; said
Mr. Haig, and in the laugh that followed the doctor
and his wife rose to go. A neighboring woman
with a baby in her arms had come in and
seated herself near the door. As he passed out
the doctor stopped to inquire, &ldquo;How's that sore
breast? You haven't been back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's about well. William found a mole at
last and when I put the skin of it on my breast
it cured it. I knowed it would, but when we
wanted a mole there wasn't none to be found, so
I had to go and see <em>you</em> about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it would soon be well. Good for
the mole-skin,&rdquo; laughed the doctor, as they took
their leave.</p>

<p>When they had started homeward they looked
at each other, the doctor with a smile in his eyes&mdash;he
had encountered this sort of thing so often
in his professional life that he was quite accustomed
to it. But Mary's brown eyes were serious.
&ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when will the reign of
ignorance and superstition end?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Time shall be no more, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it seems. Those people, while lacking education,
seem to be fairly intelligent and yet their
lives are dominated by things like these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and not only people of fair intelligence
but of fair education too. While they would
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_180" title="180"> </a>
laugh at what we saw and heard back there they
are holding fast to things equally senseless and
ridiculous. Then there are thoroughly educated
and cultured people holding fast to little superstitions
which had their birth in ignorance away
back in the past somewhere. How many people
do you know who want to see the new moon over
the left shoulder? And didn't I hear you commanding
Jack just the other day to take the
hoe right out of the house and to go out the
same door he came in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, ye-es, but then <em>nobody</em> wants to have a <em>hoe</em>
carried through the house, John. It's such a
bad sign&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor laughed. &ldquo;This thing is so widespread
there seems to be no hope of eliminating
it entirely though I believe physicians are doing
more than anybody else toward crushing it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can they reason and argue people out of
these things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not often. Good-natured ridicule is an effective
shaft and one I like to turn upon them
sometimes. They get so they don't want to say
those things to me, and so perhaps they get to
see after a while that it is just as well not to
say them too often to other people, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't drive so fast, John, the day is too glorious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yellow butterflies flitted hither and thither
down the road; the corn in the fields was turning
brown and out from among it peeped here and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_181" title="181"> </a>
there a pumpkin; the trees in apple orchards
were bending low with their rosy and golden
treasures. They passed a pool of water and saw
reflected there the purple asters blooming above
it. By and by the doctor turned down a grassy
road leading up to a farmhouse a short distance
away. &ldquo;Are you to make another call today?&rdquo;
asked his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is a very sick child here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he had gone inside three or four children
came out. A curly-headed little girl edged
close and looked up into Mary's face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss' Blank, <em>you</em> know where Mr. Blank got
our baby, <em>don't</em> you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary, smiling down at the little questioner,
said, &ldquo;The doctor didn't tell me anything about
it.&rdquo; The little faces looked surprised and disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We thought you'd know an' we come out to
ask you,&rdquo; said another little girl. &ldquo;You make
all the babies' dresses, don't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, no indeed!&rdquo; laughed the doctor's
wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he keep all the babies at your house?&rdquo;
asked the little boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not. I never see them there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn't he ever bring any to your house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, five of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd watch and see where he <em>gets</em> 'em,&rdquo; said
the little fellow stoutly. &ldquo;Jimmie Brown said
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_182" title="182"> </a>
Mr. Blank found their baby down in the woods
in an old holler log.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor came out, and the little boy looking
up at him asked, &ldquo;Is they any more babies
down in the woods?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, &lsquo;the woods is full of 'em,&rsquo;&rdquo; laughed
the doctor as he drove off leaving the little group
quite unsatisfied.</p>

<p>When they had gone some distance two wagons
appeared on the brow of the hill in front of
them. &ldquo;Hold on, Doctor,&rdquo; shouted the first
driver, as the doctor was driving rapidly by, &ldquo;I
want to sell you a watermelon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you take your pay in pills?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't b'lieve I have any use for pills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't want one then, I'm broke this morning,&rdquo;
and he passed the second wagon and pulled
his horse into the road again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute! <em>I'll</em> trade you a melon for
some pills,&rdquo; called the driver. He spread the
reins over the dashboard and clambered down;
the man in front looked back at him with a grin.
&ldquo;I've got two kinds here, the Cyclone and the
Monarch, which would you rather have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't care,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us have a Monarch, please,&rdquo; said Mary.
Monarch was a prettier name than Cyclone, and
besides there was no sense in giving so violent
a name to so peaceful a thing as a watermelon.
So the Monarch was brought and deposited in
the back of the buggy.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_183" title="183"> </a>The doctor opened his case. &ldquo;Take your
choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you call this kind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call that kind Little Devils.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many of 'em would a feller dare take
at once?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn't take more than three unless
you have a lawyer handy to make your will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, will they hurt me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They'll bring the answer if you take enough
of 'em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man eyed the pills dubiously,&mdash;&ldquo;I believe
I'll let that kind alone. What kind is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are podophyllin pills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, the <em>name's</em> enough to kill a feller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Morning-Glories is a good name. If
you take too many you'll be wafted straight to
glory in the morning, and the road will be a
little rough in places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound it, Jake,&rdquo; called the first driver,
&ldquo;don't you take <em>none</em> of 'em. Don't monkey with
'em.&rdquo; But Jake had agreed to trade a melon for
pills. He held out his big hand. &ldquo;Pour me out
some of them Little Devils. I'll risk 'em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor emptied the small bottle into Jake's
hand, replaced it in the case and drove off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, why in the world didn't you give him
some instructions as to how to take them?&rdquo; asked
Mary, energetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn't ask me to prescribe for him, my
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_184" title="184"> </a>
dear. He wanted to trade a watermelon for pills
and we traded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For pity's sake,&rdquo; said Mary indignantly, &ldquo;and
you're going to let that man kill himself while
you strain at a point of professional etiquette!&rdquo;
She was gazing back at the unfortunate man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you worry, he'll be too much afraid
of them to hurt himself with them,&rdquo; said the doctor,
laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sincerely hope he will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they came in sight of home the doctor,
who had been silent for some time, sighed heavily.
&ldquo;I am thinking of that little child out there.
I tell you, Mary, a case of meningitis makes a
man feel his limitations.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_185" title="185"> </a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p>A long, importunate peal. The doctor rose
and went swiftly. Mary listened with interest
to what was to come:</p>

<p>&ldquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rang off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was decided in the affirmative,&rdquo; said
Mary.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, do you think the baby will cut any
more teeth this summer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd better ring up Solomon and ask that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;if he gets through teething&mdash;don't
you think he'll be all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he gets through with the way you <em>feed</em> him
he'll be all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_186" title="186"> </a>&ldquo;Well, his teething has lots to do with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it don't&mdash;not a darned bit. If you'll
take care of his stomach his teeth will take care
of themselves. It's what goes <em>between</em> the teeth
that does the mischief. I keep telling people that
every day, and once in a while I find someone
with sense enough to believe it. But a lot of 'em
know too much&mdash;then the baby has to pay
for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I'll be awful careful, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right then. And stick right to the baby
through the hot months. Let me hear from it.
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling&mdash;three times. Mary rose
and went. An agitated voice said, &ldquo;Come and
see the baby!&rdquo; and was gone. &ldquo;She is terribly
frightened,&rdquo; thought Mary, as she rang central.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one rang Dr. Blank. Can you find
out who it was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm afraid not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please try?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but people ought to do their own talking
and not bother us so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Mary gently, &ldquo;but this is a
mother badly frightened about her baby&mdash;she
did not think what she was doing and left the
'phone without giving me her name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Central tried with such good result that Mary
was soon in possession of the name and number.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_187" title="187"> </a>
She telephoned that she would send the doctor
down as soon as she could find him, which she
thought would be in a few minutes. Then she
telephoned a house where he had been for several
days making evening visits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Dr. Blank there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He <em>was</em> here. He's just gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he too far away for you to call him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run and see, Tommy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence. Then, &ldquo;Yes, he's got too far to hear.
I'm sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very <ins title="well">well.</ins> Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; she meditated, &ldquo;yes, I think he
goes there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She got the house. &ldquo;Is Dr. Blank there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's just coming through the gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please ask him to come to the 'phone.&rdquo; After
a minute his voice asked what was wanted and
Mary delivered her message.</p>

<p>When her husband came home that night, she
said, &ldquo;John, there's one more place you're to go
and you're to be there at nine o'clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo; he looked at his watch, &ldquo;ten
minutes to nine now. Where is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I haven't the slightest idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn't you find out,&rdquo; he asked, sharply.
Mary arched her brows. &ldquo;Suppose <em>you</em> find out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John rang central. With twinkling eyes his
wife listened.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_188" title="188"> </a>&ldquo;Hello, central. Who was calling Dr. Blank a
while ago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good many people call, Dr. Blank. I really
cannot say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice was icily regular, <ins title="spendidly">splendidly</ins> null. It
nettled the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you try to find out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People who need a doctor ought to be as
much interested as we are. I don't know who
it was.&rdquo; And the receiver went up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damned impudence!&rdquo; said the doctor, slamming
up his receiver and facing about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, John. That girl has had to run down
the woman with the sick baby. She didn't give
<em>her</em> name either. Central had lots of trouble in
finding her. It's small wonder she rebelled when
I came at her the second time. So all I could
do was to deliver the message just as it came,
&lsquo;Tell the doctor to come down to our house and
to be here at nine o'clock.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consultation, I suppose. They'll ring again
pretty soon, I dare say, and want to know why
I don't hurry up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But nothing further was heard from the message
or the messenger that night or ever after.</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>The baby pulled the cat's tail and she scratched
her in the face. I'm afraid she's put her eye

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The baby has a cold and I rubbed her chest
with vaseline and greased her nose. Is that all
right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_190" title="190"> </a>&ldquo;And I am going to make her some onion

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;O, <em>you</em> remember how to make it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The truth is the doctor was not profoundly
learned in some of the &ldquo;home remedies&rdquo; and was
more helpless than the little mother herself,
which she did not suspect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You slice the onions and put sugar on them,
don't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that'll be all right,&rdquo; he said, hastily putting
up the receiver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo; The doctor turned quickly from
the 'phone, but it rang again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for my back, Doctor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. <em>Yes!</em>&rdquo; He put the receiver up with a

<p>Three rings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank's?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I expect him very soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_191" title="191"> </a>&ldquo;When he comes will you tell him to come
out to Frank Tiller's?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he know where that is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was here once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, some time ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please tell me what street you live on, so the

consultation of a minute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's on Oak street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;East Oak or West?&rdquo; Another consultation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;North.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. I'll tell the doctor as soon as he
comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him to come as quick as he possibly can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Five minutes later the office ring came. Mary
went obediently lest her husband might not be
in. She heard the same voice ask, &ldquo;Is this you,
Doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want you to come out to Frank Tiller's
as quick as you possibly can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;North.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That street runs east and west!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ma, he says the street runs east and west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<ins title="Well">Well,</ins> maybe it does. I've not got my directions
here yet&mdash;then it must be west.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_192" title="192"> </a>&ldquo;It's on West Oak street, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor was not quite able to locate the
place yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it the house where the girl had the sore
throat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ma, he says, is it the place where the girl had
the sore throat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's just in front of that house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She says it's just in front of that house and

<p>&ldquo;What does she mean by &lsquo;in front of it&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it's just across the street, and come
just as quick as you possibly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I'll <em>run</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary smiled, but she was glad to hear her husband
add a little more pleasantly, &ldquo;I'll be out
there after a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he came home he said, laughing, &ldquo;That
girl up there took the medicine I gave her and
pounded the bottle to flinders before my eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, she was mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reached down in my pocket and took out
another one just like it and told them to give
it according to directions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing like being prepared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew pretty well what I was up against before
I went. The old complaint,&rdquo; said John,
drawing on his slippers as he spoke.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_193" title="193"> </a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p>Mary had been down the street, shopping.
&ldquo;I'll drop in and visit with John a few minutes,&rdquo;
she thought, as she drew near the office. When
she entered her husband was at the telephone
with his back toward her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shake up your 'phone, I can't hear a word
you're saying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, <em>I</em> know.&rdquo; Exasperation was in every
letter of every word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take one every six months and let me hear
from you when they're all gone.&rdquo; Slam! &ldquo;There's
always <em>some</em> damned thing,&rdquo; he muttered, and
turning faced his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A surprising prescription, John. What does
it mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means that she's one of these everlasting
complainers and that I'm tired of hearing her.
She's been to Chicago and St. Louis and Cincinnati.
She's had three or four laparotomies and
every time she comes back to me with a longer
story and a worse one. They've got about
everything but her appendix and they'll get that
if she don't watch out.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_194" title="194"> </a>&ldquo;Why, I thought they always got that the first
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no idea how it tires a man to have
people come to him and complain, complain,
<em>complain</em>. The story is ever new to them but it
gets mighty old to the doctor. Then they go
away to the city and some surgeon with a great
name does what may seem to him to be best.
Sometimes they come back improved, sometimes
not, and sometimes they come back worse
than when they went. In all probability the operator
never sees the patient again and so the
last chapters of the story must be told to the
home doctor over and over again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary gave a little sigh. The doctor went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In many cases it isn't treatment of any kind
that is needed. It is occupation&mdash;occupation
for the mind and for the hands. Something that
will make people forget themselves in their work
or in their play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this you, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to see if you were at the office. I'll
be over there right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few minutes the door opened and a gentleman
about thirty-five years of age entered. His
manner was greatly agitated and he did not notice
Mrs. Blank at the window near the corner
of the room.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_195" title="195"> </a>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Blake,&rdquo; said the doctor,
shaking hands with him, &ldquo;back again, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Blake had been to C&mdash;, his native city.
He had not been well for some time and had
evinced a desire to go back and consult his old
physician there, in which Dr. Blank had heartily
concurred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long do you think I can live?&rdquo; Mr.
Blake asked now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; replied the doctor, regarding
him closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to know how much time I have. I
want to get my business fixed up before&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blake, you couldn't die if you wanted to.
You're not a sick enough man for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The patient took a letter from his pocket and
handed it in silence to the doctor. The latter
took it, looked carefully at the superscription,
read it slowly through, then folded it with cool
deliberation and put it back into the envelope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were going to your old physician,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Kenton was out of the city so I went to
the great specialist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you what was in this letter he sent
to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but the letter was not sealed and I read
it. I was so anxious to know his opinion that
I couldn't help it. Tuberculosis of the larynx&mdash;&rdquo;
his voice faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the doctor, calmly, &ldquo;that is a thing
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_196" title="196"> </a>
a man may well be frightened about. But listen
to me, Blake. You've not got tuberculosis of the
larynx.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think a great physician like Dr. Wentworth
doesn't know what he is talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Wentworth is a great physician; I know
him well. But he is only a man like the rest of
us and therefore liable to err in judgment sometimes.
He knew you half an hour, perhaps, before
he pronounced upon your case. I have
known you and watched you for fifteen years. I
say you have not got tuberculosis <em>and I know I
am right</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary saw Mr. Blake grasp her husband's
hand with a look in his face that made her think
within herself, &ldquo;Blessings on the country doctor
wherever he may be, who has experience and
knowledge and wisdom enough to draw just and
true conclusions of his own and bravely state
them when occasion demands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the patient had gone Mary said to her
husband, &ldquo;One gets a kaleidoscopic view of life
in a doctor's office. What comes through the ear
at home comes before the eye here. The kaleidoscope
turned a bright-colored bit into the place
of a dark one this time, John. I am glad I
was here to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke footsteps were heard on the
stairs. Slow and feeble steps they were, but at
last they reached the landing and paused at the
open door. Looking out Mary saw a poorly clad
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_197" title="197"> </a>
woman perhaps forty years of age, carrying in
her hands a speckled hen. She was pale and
trembling violently, and sank down exhausted
into the chair the doctor set for her. He took
the hen from her hands and set it on the floor.
Its feet were securely tied and it made no effort
to escape. The doctor had never seen the woman
before but noting the emaciated form and the
hectic flush on the cheek he saw that consumption
was fast doing its work. Mary took the palm
leaf fan lying on the table and stood beside her,
fanning her gently.</p>

<p>When the woman could speak she said, &ldquo;I
oughtn't to 'a' tried to walk, Doctor, but there
didn't seem to be anyone passin' an' this cough
is killin' me. I want something for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far did you walk?&rdquo; asked Mary, kindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four mile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four miles!&rdquo; she looked down at the trembling
form with deep pity in her brown eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't have any money, Doctor, but will the
hen pay for the medicine?&rdquo; her eyes were
raised anxiously to his face and Mary's eyes met
the look in the eyes of her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want the hen. We haven't any place
to keep her. Besides my wife, here, is afraid
of hens.&rdquo; A little smile flitted across the wan
face.</p>

<p>He told her how to take the medicine and then
said, &ldquo;Whenever you need any more let me know
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_198" title="198"> </a>
and I'll send it to you. You needn't worry about
the pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm very much obleeged to you, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just take the hen back home with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I couldn't sell her at the store,&rdquo;
she said, looking at the doctor with a bright, expectant
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait here and rest awhile and then we'll see
about it. I'll go down and perhaps I can find
some one in town from out your way that you
can ride home with. Where do you live?&rdquo; She
told him and he went down the stairs. In a little
while he came back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of your neighbors is down here now
waiting for you. He's just starting home,&rdquo; he
said. He took the hen and as they started down
the stairs Mary came out and joined them. At
the foot of the stairway he said to the grocer
standing in front of his establishment, &ldquo;Here,
Keller, I want you to give me a dollar for this
hen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She ain't worth it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She <em>is</em> worth it,&rdquo; said the doctor so emphatically
that Keller put his hand in his pocket and
handed out the dollar. The poor woman did not
see the half dollar that passed from the doctor's
hand to the grocer's, but Mary saw and was glad.</p>

<p>The doctor laid the dollar in the trembling
palm, helped the feeble woman into the wagon
and they drove off.</p>

<p>Mary turned to her husband and said with a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_199" title="199"> </a>
little break in her voice, &ldquo;I'm going home, John.
I want to get away from your kaleidoscope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I must go for another peep into it. Good-bye.
Come again.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Jim Sampson, Doctor, out at Sampson's
mill. My boy fell out of a tree a while
ago and broke his leg, and I'm sort o' worried
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It don't have to <em>stay</em> broke, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's just the point. I'm afraid it will&mdash;for
a while at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my wife says she won't have it set
unless the signs are right for setting a broken
bone. She's great on the almanac signs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil! You have that bone <em>set</em>&mdash;<em>today</em>!
Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but Mary's awful set in her way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm a darned sight more set. That boy's not
going to lie there and suffer because of a fool
whim of his mother's. Where is she? Send her
to the 'phone and I'll talk to <em>her</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She couldn't find her almanac and ran across
to the neighbor's to get one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me when she gets back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed and the call came.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_200" title="200"> </a>&ldquo;It's all right, Doctor, the signs says so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A note of humor but of unmistakable relief
vibrated in the voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come right out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Jim, I'll be out as soon as I make
my round here in town. Tell your wife to have
that almanac handy. I may learn something
from it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An hour or two later he was starting out to
get into the buggy, with splints and other needful
things when the 'phone called him back. Hastily
cramming them under the seat he went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Millie Hastings. Do you remember
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No-o&mdash;I don't believe I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You doctored me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I've &lsquo;doctored&rsquo; several people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had typhoid fever two years ago up in the
country at my uncle's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's your uncle's name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry Peters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to find out what my bill is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait here a moment till I look at the book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a minute he had found it: Millie Hastings&mdash;so
many visits at such and such a date,
amounting to thirty-six dollars. He went back
to the 'phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you make your money by working by the
week?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_201" title="201"> </a>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you learned how to save it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I had to. I have to help mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your bill is eighteen dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He heard a little gasp, then a delighted voice
said: &ldquo;I was afraid it would be a good deal
more. And now Dr. Blank, I want to ask a
favor of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought four dollars to town with me today
to pay on my bill, but I want a rocking chair <em>so</em>
bad&mdash;I'm over here at the furniture store now&mdash;and
there's such a nice one here that just costs
four dollars and I thought maybe you'd wait
a<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Certainly</em> I will. Get the rocking chair by
all means,&rdquo; and he laughed heartily as he went
out to the buggy. He climbed in and drove
away, the smile still lingering on his face. At
the outskirts of the town a tall girl hailed him
from the sidewalk. He stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just going to your office to get my
medicine,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left it with the man there. He'll give it
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must I take it just like the other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Laugh some, though, just before you
take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you won't feel like it afterward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl looked after him as he drove on.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_202" title="202"> </a>&ldquo;He's laughing,&rdquo; she said to herself and a grin
overspread her face as she pursued her leisurely
way.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling!!!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must be something unusual,&rdquo; thought Mary
as the doctor went to the 'phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, is this you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come out to John Lansing's quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife swallowed poison. Hurry, Doctor,
for God's <ins title="sake!">sake!&rdquo;</ins></p>

<p>In a few minutes the doctor was on his horse
(the roads being too bad for a buggy) and was
off. We will follow him as he plunges along
through the darkness.</p>

<p>Because of the mud the horse's progress was
so slow that the doctor pulled him to one side,
urged him on to the board walk, much against his
inclination, and went clattering on at such a pace
that the doors began to fly open on both sides of
the street and heads, turned wonderingly after
the fleeting horseman, were framed in rectangles
of light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <em>is</em> the matter out there?&rdquo; The angle
of the heads said it so plainly that the doctor
laughed within himself as he thundered on. Now
it chanced that one of the heads belonged to a
Meddlesome Matty who, next day, stirred the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_203" title="203"> </a>
matter up, and that evening two officers of the
law presented themselves at Dr. Blank's office
and arrested him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care anything about the fine. All I
wanted was to get there,&rdquo; he said, handing out
the three dollars.</p>

<p>After the horse left the board walk the road
became more solid and in about ten minutes the
doctor arrived at his destination. Before he
could knock the door was opened. The patient
sat reclining in a chair, motionless, rigid, her eyes
closed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has she taken?&rdquo; asked the doctor of
the woman's husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laudanum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She told me she took this bottle full,&rdquo; and
he held up a two ounce bottle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she's lying,&rdquo; thought the doctor as he
laid his fingers upon her pulse. Then he raised
the lids and looked carefully at the pupils of the
eyes. &ldquo;Not much contraction here,&rdquo; he thought.
Turning to the husband who stood pale and
trembling beside him, he said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't be alarmed&mdash;she's in no more danger
than you are.&rdquo; He watched the patient's face
as he spoke and saw what he expected&mdash;a
faint facial movement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be on the safe side we'll treat the case
as if she had taken two ounces.&rdquo; He gave her
a hypodermic emetic then called for warm water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; asked the husband.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_204" title="204"> </a>&ldquo;O, a half gallon will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A big fat woman came panting through the
doorway. &ldquo;I got here as quick as I could,&rdquo; she
gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don't need you at all,&rdquo; said the doctor
quietly. &ldquo;Better go back home to your children,
Mrs. Johnson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Johnson, not liking to be cheated out of
a sensation which she dearly loved, stood still.
Mr. Lansing came back with the warm water. A
faint slit appeared under the eyelids of the patient.
The doctor took the big cup and said abruptly,
&ldquo;Here! drink this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>No response. &ldquo;Mrs. Lansing!&rdquo; he said so
sharply that her eyes opened. &ldquo;Drink this
water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ca-an't,&rdquo; she murmured feebly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won't,&rdquo; the voice was getting stronger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'll see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I'll see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held the big vessel to her mouth. When
the water began to pour down her neck she
sprang to her feet fighting it off. He held the
cup in his left hand while with his right he
reached around her neck and took her firmly by
the nose. Then he held the cup against her
mouth and when it opened for breath he poured
the life-saving fluid forcefully down. Great
gulps of it were swallowed while a wide sheet of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_205" title="205"> </a>
water poured down her neck and over her night-dress
to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was very well done. Better sit down
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The husband stood in awed silence. The fat
woman shook her fist at the doctor's back which
he beheld, nothing daunted, in the looking-glass
on the wall. The patient herself sat down in
absolute quiet. In a minute she began retching
and vomited some of the water. The doctor inspected
it carefully. Then he went to his overcoat
on a chair, felt in the pocket and drew out
a coil of something. It looked like red rubber
and was about half an inch in diameter. He
slowly unwound it. It was five or six feet in
length. A subdued voice asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do now, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to turn on the hose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha-a-t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to put this tube down into your
stomach. You haven't thrown up much of that
laudanum yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She opened her mouth to speak and the doctor
inserted one end of the tube and began ramming
it down. &ldquo;Unfasten a button or two here,&rdquo;
he said to her husband and rammed some more.
She gagged and gurgled and tried to push his
hands away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, we're not down yet&mdash;we're only
about to the third button.&rdquo; He began ramming
the tube again when she looked up at her husband
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_206" title="206"> </a>
so imploringly that he said, &ldquo;Hold on a
minute, Doctor, she wants to say something.&rdquo;
The doctor withdrew the tube and waited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sure I threw it all up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; he said beginning to lift it again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;only&mdash;took&mdash;two&mdash;or three drops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the devil didn't you say so at the start?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had. I just told <em>Jim</em> that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To get even with him for something,&rdquo; announced
the doctor quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can he know so much,&rdquo; mused Jim's
wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I advise you not to try this game again,&rdquo;
said the doctor as he wound up the stomach tube
and put it into his pocket. &ldquo;You can't fool Jim
all the time, and you can't fool me any of the
time. Good night.&rdquo; And he rode home and
found Mary asleep in her chair.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this you, Dr. Blank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to ask you about an electric vibrator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An electric vibrator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An electric something&mdash;I didn't get the last
word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little laugh, then &ldquo;v-i-b-r-a-t-o-r.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! vibrator.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_207" title="207"> </a>&ldquo;Yes. Do you think it would help my aunt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a durned bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another little laugh, &ldquo;You don't think it
would?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a letter today from my cousin and she
said she knew a lady who had had a stroke and
this vibrator helped her more than anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It didn't. She imagined it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn't know anything about it and I
knew you would, so I thought I'd 'phone you before
going any further. Much obliged, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would save much time and money and disappointment
if all those who don't know would
pause to put a question or two to those who do.
But so it is <em>not</em>, and the maker of worthless devices
and the concocter of nostrums galore
cometh oft to fortune by leaps and bounds, while
the poor, conscientious physician who sticks to
the truth of things, arriveth betimes at starvation's
gate.</p>

<p>(I was startled a few days ago to learn that
the average income of physicians in the United
States does not exceed six hundred dollars.)</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell papa he's wanted at the 'phone,&rdquo; said
Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn't he there in the dining room?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_208" title="208"> </a>&ldquo;No, he isn't here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be in the kitchen then; go to the
door and call him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The small boy obeyed. &ldquo;He's not out here
either,&rdquo; he announced from the door-way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, where can he be!&rdquo; cried Mary, springing
up and going swiftly to the 'phone. &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the doctor there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Wait just a minute and I will call him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hurried through the dining room, then
through the kitchen and out into the yard. No
doctor to be seen. &ldquo;He passed through the house
not three minutes ago,&rdquo; she said to herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doc-<em>tor</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, dear! I don't see how he could disappear
from the face of the earth in three minutes'
time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hurried around a projecting corner
through a little gate and called again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked a placid voice as its owner
emerged from his new auto garage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry to the 'phone for pity's sake!&rdquo; and he
hurried. Mary, following, all out of breath,
heard this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two teaspoonfuls.&rdquo; Then the doctor hung
up the receiver. He turned to Mary and laughed
as he quoted Emerson on the mountain and the
mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I chased you all over the place this afternoon,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_209" title="209"> </a>
John, when the 'phone was calling you, and
couldn't find you at all. Some people have days
to &lsquo;appear&rsquo; but this seems to be your day to disappear.
Where were you then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out in the garage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fascinating spot! I'll know where to look
next time. Now come to supper.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>On a lovely afternoon our travelers were driving
leisurely along through partially cleared
woodland. The doctor had proposed that they
take this trip in the new automobile. But Mary
had declined with great firmness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not be hurled along the road in October
of all months. What fools these mortals be,&rdquo;
she went on. &ldquo;Last year while driving slowly
through the glorious Austrian Tyrol fairly holding
my breath with delight, one machine after
another whizzed by, the occupants fancying they
were &lsquo;doing&rsquo; the Tyrol, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary looked about her, drinking in deep
draughts of the delicious air. The beautifully-tinted
leaves upon every tree and bush, the blue
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_211" title="211"> </a>
haze in the distance and the dreamful melancholy
over all, were delightful to her. The fragrance
of wild grapes came to them as they
emerged from the woods and Mary said,
&ldquo;Couldn't you wait a minute, John, until I go
back and find them? I'll bring you some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you were sick and had sent for a doctor
would you like to have him fool around gathering
grapes and everything else on his way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I wouldn't. I really wouldn't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They laughed as they sped along the open
country road, skirted on either side by a rail
fence. From a fence corner here and there
arose tall sumac, like candelabra bearing aloft
their burning tapers. The poke-weed flung out
its royal purple banners while golden-rod and
asters were blooming everywhere. Suddenly
Mary exclaimed, &ldquo;I'm going to get out of the
buggy this minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To gather those brown bunches of hazelnuts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary, I positively will not wait for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, I positively don't want you to wait for
me,&rdquo; said Mary, putting her foot on the step,
&ldquo;I'm going to stay here and gather nuts till you
come back. See how many there are?&rdquo; and she
sprang lightly to the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be an hour or more before I can get
back. I've got to take up that pesky artery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won't seem long. You know I like to be
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_212" title="212"> </a>&ldquo;Good-bye, then,&rdquo; and the doctor started off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait! John,&rdquo; his wife called after him. &ldquo;I
haven't a thing to put the nuts in, please throw
me the laprobe.&rdquo; The doctor crushed the robe
into a sort of bundle and threw it to her.</p>

<p>She spread the robe upon the ground and began
plucking the bunches. Her fingers flew
nimbly over the bushes and soon she had a pile
of the brown treasures. Dear old times came
trooping back. She thought of far-off autumn
days when she had taken her little wagon and
gone out to the hazel bushes growing near her
father's house, and filled it to the top and
tramped it down and filled it yet again. Then
a gray October day came back when three or
four girls and boys, all busy in the bushes, talked
in awed tones of the great fire&mdash;Chicago was
burning up! Big, big Chicago, which they had
never seen or dreamed of seeing&mdash;all because
a cow kicked over a lamp.</p>

<p>Mary moved to another clump of bushes. As
she worked she thought if she had never known
the joy of gathering nuts and wild grapes and
persimmons, of wandering through woods and
meadows, her childhood would have lost much
that is beautiful and best, and her womanhood
many of its dearest recollections.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're the doctor's wife, ain't ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary looked around quite startled. A tall woman
in a blue calico dress and a brown gingham
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_213" title="213"> </a>
sunbonnet was standing there. &ldquo;I didn't want
to scare ye, I guess you didn't see me comin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't know you were coming&mdash;yes, I am
the doctor's wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We saw ye from the house and supposed he'd
gone on to see old man Benning and that you
had stopped to pick nuts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You guessed it exactly,&rdquo; said Mary with a
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We live about a quarter mile back from the
road so I didn't see the doctor in time to stop
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is some one sick at your house, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my man ain't a doin' right, somehow.
He's been ailin' for some time and his left foot
and leg is a turnin' blue. I come to see if you
could tell me somethin' I could do for it. I'm
afraid it's mortifyin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary's brown eyes opened wide. &ldquo;Why, my
dear woman, I couldn't tell you anything to do.
I don't know anything at all about such things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I supposed bein' a doctor's wife you'd learnt
everything like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have learned many things by being a doctor's
wife, very many things, but what to do with a
leg and foot that are mortifying I really could
not tell you.&rdquo; Mary turned her face away to
hide a laugh that was getting near the surface.
&ldquo;I will have the doctor drive up to the house
when he gets back if you wish,&rdquo; she said, turning
to her companion.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_214" title="214"> </a>&ldquo;Maybe that would be best. Your husband
cured me once when I thought nothing would
ever get me well again. I think more of him
than any other man in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you. So do I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started off and Mary went on gathering
nuts, her face breaking into smiles at the queer
errand and the restorative power imputed to
herself. &ldquo;If it is as serious as she thinks, all
the doctors in the world can't do much for it,
much less one meek and humble doctor's wife.
But they could amputate, I suppose, and I'm sure
I couldn't, not in a scientific way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus soliloquizing, she went from clump to
clump of the low bushes till they were bereft of
their fruitage. She looked down well-pleased at
the robe with the nuts piled upon it. She drew
the corners up and tied her bundle securely. This
done she looked down the road where the doctor
had disappeared. &ldquo;I'll just walk on and meet
him,&rdquo; she thought. She went leisurely along,
stopping now and then to pluck a spray of goldenrod.
When she had gathered quite a bunch
she looked at it closely. &ldquo;You are like some people
in this world&mdash;you have a pretty name and
at a little distance <em>you</em> are pretty: but seen too
close you are a disappointment, and more than
that you are coarse. I don't want you,&rdquo; and she
flung them away. She saw dust rising far down
the road and hoped it might be the doctor. Yes,
it was he, and Bucephalus seemed to know that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_215" title="215"> </a>
he was traveling toward home. When her husband
came up and she was seated beside him,
she said, &ldquo;You are wanted at that little house
over yonder,&rdquo; and she told him what had taken
place in the hazel bushes. &ldquo;You're second choice
though, they came for me first,&rdquo; she said laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to thunder you'd gone. They owe me
a lot now they'll never pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate, they hold you in very high esteem,
John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, but esteem butters no bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you'll go, won't you? I told the woman
you would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I'll go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned into a narrow lane and in a few
minutes they were at the gate. The doctor
handed the reins to Mary and went inside. A
girl fourteen or fifteen years old with a bald-headed
baby on her arm came out of the house
and down the path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won't you come in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you. We will be going home in
a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl set the baby on the gate-post. &ldquo;She's
the smartest baby I ever saw,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She's
got a whole mouthful of teeth already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how old is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was ten months old three weeks ago last
Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As today was Thursday, Mary was on the point
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_216" title="216"> </a>
of saying, &ldquo;She will be eleven months old in a
few days then,&rdquo; but checked herself&mdash;she understood.
It would detract from the baby's
smartness to give her eleven months instead of
only ten in which to accomplish such wonders
in the way of teeth. The doctor came out and
they started. Just before they came out to the
main road they passed an old deserted house. No
signs of life were about it except the very luxuriant
life in the tall jimsons and ragweeds
growing about it and reaching almost to the top
of the low doorway, yawning blackly behind
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the longest night of my life was spent
in that house about sixteen years ago. It's the
only house I was ever in where there was nothing
at all to read. There wasn't even an almanac.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary laughed. &ldquo;An almanac is a great deal
better than nothing, my dear. I found that out
once upon a time when I had to stay in a house
for several hours where there was just one almanac
and not another printed page. I read the
jokes two or three times till they began to pall
and then set to work on the signs. I'll always
have a regard for them because they gave me a
lift through those tedious hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were not far from the western edge of
the piece of woodland they were traversing and
all about them was the soft red light of the setting
sun. They could see the sun himself away
off through the straight and solemn trunks of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_217" title="217"> </a>
the trees. A mile farther on Mary uttered a
sudden exclamation of delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See that lovely bittersweet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see, but don't ask me to stop and get you
some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won't, but I'll ask you to stop and let <em>me</em>
get some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't bother about it. You'll have to
scramble over that ditch and up the bank&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've scrambled over worse things in my life,&rdquo;
she said, springing from the buggy and picking
her way down the intervening ditch. The bright
red berries in their flaring yellow hoods were
beautiful. She began breaking off the branches.
When she had gathered a large bunch and was
turning toward the buggy she saw a vehicle containing
two women approaching from the opposite
direction. There was a ditch on either side
of the road which, being narrow at this point,
made passing a delicate piece of work. The doctor
drew his horse to one side so that the wheels
of the buggy rested on the very brink and waited
for them to pass; he saw that there was room
with perhaps a foot or two to spare.</p>

<p>On came the travelers and&mdash;the front
wheels of the two vehicles were locked
in a close embrace. For a minute the
doctor did some vigorous thinking and
then he climbed out of the buggy. It was a
trying position. He could not say all of the
things he wanted to&mdash;it would not be polite;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_218" title="218"> </a>
neither did he want to act as if it were nothing
because Mary might not understand the extent
of the mischief she had caused and how much
out of humor he was with her. It would be
easier if she were only out of hearing instead of
looking at him across the ditch with apologetic
eyes.</p>

<p>The doctor's horse began to move uneasily but
the other stood perfectly still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's used to this sort of thing, perhaps,&rdquo; said
the doctor with as little sarcasm as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have run into a good many buggies
and things,&rdquo; said one of the women, cheerfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women beat the devil when it comes to driving,&rdquo;
thought the doctor within himself. &ldquo;They'll
drive right over you and never seem to think
they ought to give part of the road. And they
do it everywhere, not only where there are
ditches.&rdquo; He restrained his speech, backed the
offending vehicle and started the travelers on.
While he was doing so his own steed started
on and he had a lively run to catch him.</p>

<p>Mary had thought of turning back to break
off another spray of the bittersweet but John's
profanity was rising to heaven. Diplomacy required
her to get to the buggy and into it at once.
This she did and the doctor plunged in after
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me for keeping you waiting,&rdquo; she
said gently. She held the bittersweet out before
her. &ldquo;Isn't it lovely, John?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_219" title="219"> </a>A soft observation turneth away wrath. The
doctor's was oozing away sooner than he wished.</p>

<p>They drove on for a while in silence. The soft,
still landscape dotted here and there with farm
houses and with graceful elm and willow trees,
was lit up and glorified by the after-glow. The
evening sky arching serenely over a quiet world,
how beautiful it was! And as Mary's eyes
caught a glittering point of light in the blue vault
above them, she sang softly to herself:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&ldquo;O, thou sublime, sweet evening star,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">Joyful I greet thee from afar.&rdquo;<br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For a while she watched the stars as one by
one they twinkled into view, then drawing her
wraps more closely about her, she leaned back in
the carriage and gave herself up to pleasant reflection,
and before she realized it the lights of
home were twinkling cheerily ahead.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_220" title="220"> </a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p>&ldquo;You are not going out tonight, John, no matter
how often the 'phone rings. I positively will
not let you.&rdquo; Mary spoke with strong emphasis.
All the night before he had been up and today
had been a hard day for him. She had seldom
seen him so utterly weary as he was tonight. He
had come home earlier than usual and now sat
before the fire, his head sunk on his breast, half
asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go right to bed, dear, then you can really
rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor, too tired to offer any resistance,
rose and went to the bedroom. In a few minutes
his wife heard regular sonorous sounds from the
bed. (When she spoke of these sounds to John,
Mary pronounced it without the first <i>o</i>.)</p>

<p>Glad that he had so soon fallen into deep
sleep she settled back in her chair. &ldquo;I'll protect
him tonight,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;though fiery darts
be hurled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thought of many things. The fire-light
gleamed red upon the hearth. All was still. The
sounds from the adjoining room had ceased.
Something stirred within her and she rose and
went softly to the bedside of her sleeping husband.
In the half-light she could see the strong,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_221" title="221"> </a>
good face. Dear John so profane yet so patient,
so severe yet so tender, what would it be to face
life without him. She laid her hand very lightly
on the hand which lay on the counterpane, then
took it away lest it disturb the sleeper. She went
back to her chair and opening a little volume took
from it a folded sheet. Twice before today
had she read the words written within it. A
dear friend whose husband had recently died had
written her, inclosing them. She read them again
now:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">IN MEMORIAM,&mdash;A PRAYER.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O God! The Father of the spirits of all
flesh, in whatsoever world or condition they be,&mdash;I
beseech Thee for him whose name, and
dwelling place, and every need Thou knowest.
Lord, vouchsafe him peace and light, rest and refreshment,
joy and consolation in Paradise, in
the ample folds of Thy great love. Grant that
his life, so troubled here, may unfold itself in
Thy sight, and find employment in the spacious
fields of Eternity.&mdash;If he hath ever been hurt
or maimed by any unhappy word or deed of
mine, I pray Thee, of Thy great pity, to heal and
restore him, that he may serve Thee without
hindrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him, O gracious Father, if it may be,&mdash;how
much I love him and miss him, and long to
see him again; and if there may be ways in which
he may come, vouchsafe him to me as guide and
guard, and grant me such sense of his nearness
as Thy laws permit. If in aught I can minister
to his peace, be pleased of Thy love to let this
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_222" title="222"> </a>be; and mercifully keep me from every act which
may deprive me of the sight of him, as soon as
our trial time is over, or mar the fullness of our
joy when the end of the days hath come.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mary brushed away a tear from her cheek.
&ldquo;This letter has awakened unusual thoughts. I
will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sharp peal from the telephone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the doctor at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He has gone to bed and is fast asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! We wanted him to come down to see
my sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was up all last night and is not able to
come&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I just talk to him about her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary sighed. To rouse him from his sorely
needed sleep was too cruel. Then she spoke. &ldquo;I
must not disturb him unless it is absolutely
necessary. I shall be sitting here awake&mdash;call
me again in a little while if you think it necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;l&mdash;l r&mdash;i&mdash;g&mdash;h&mdash;t&mdash;&rdquo; and a sob came
distinctly to the listener's ear.</p>

<p>This was too much for Mary. &ldquo;I'll call him,&rdquo;
she said hurriedly and went to the bedroom.</p>

<p>With much difficulty she roused him. He threw
back the covers, got up and stumbled to the
'phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello..... Yes..... They didn't? Is she suffering
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_223" title="223"> </a>
much?.... All right, I'll be down in a
little bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary groaned aloud. She had vowed to protect
him though fiery darts be hurled. But the
sob in the voice of a frightened young girl was
more potent than any fiery dart could have been
and had melted her at once. Slowly but surely
the doctor got himself into his clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think there's any use of my going
down there again, but I suppose I'll have it to
do.&rdquo; When he returned an hour later, he said,
&ldquo;Just as I thought&mdash;they were badly scared
over nothing. I shouldn't wonder if they'd rout
me out again before morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they won't,&rdquo; said Mary to herself, and
when her husband was safe in bed again, she
walked quietly to the telephone, took down the
receiver and <em>left</em> it down. &ldquo;Extreme cases require
extreme measures,&rdquo; she thought as she,
too, prepared for her night's rest. But there
was a haunting feeling in her mind about the
receiver hanging there. Suppose some one who
really did need the doctor should call and call
in vain. She would not think of it. She turned
over and fell asleep and they both slept till morning
and rose refreshed for another day.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>A few weeks later circumstances much like
those narrated above arose, and the doctor's wife
for the second and last time left the receiver
down. About two o'clock there came a tragic
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_224" title="224"> </a>
pounding at the door and when the doctor went
to open it a voice asked, &ldquo;What's the matter
down here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Central's been ringing you to beat the band
and couldn't get you awake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange we didn't hear. What's wanted?&rdquo;
He had recognized the messenger as the night
clerk at the hotel not far from his home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man hurt at the railroad&mdash;they're afraid
he'll bleed to death. Central called me and asked
me to run over here and rouse you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the doctor was gone Mary rose tremblingly
and hung up the receiver. She would not
tell John what she had done. He would be angry.
She had felt that the end justified the
means&mdash;that he was tired out and half sick and
sorely needed a night's unbroken rest&mdash;but if
the end should be the bleeding to death of this
poor man&mdash;</p>

<p>She dared not think of it. She went back to
bed but not to sleep. She lay wide awake keenly
anxious for her husband's return. And when at
last he came her lips could hardly frame the
question, &ldquo;How is he, John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty badly hurt, but not fatally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven!&rdquo; Mary whispered, and formed
a quick resolve which she never broke. This belonged
to her husband's life&mdash;it must remain a
part of it to the end.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_225" title="225"> </a>CHAPTER <ins title="XVI">XVII</ins>.</h2>

<p>One lovely morning in April, Mary was called
to the telephone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to drive to the country with me
this morning,&rdquo; said her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll be delighted. I have a little errand down
town and I'll come to the office&mdash;we can start
from there.&rdquo; Accordingly half an hour later she
walked into the office and seated herself in a
big chair to wait till John was ready. The door
opened and a small freckle-faced boy entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Governor,&rdquo; said the doctor.
The governor grinned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you today?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much will ye charge to pull a tooth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I'll pull the tooth and if it don't hurt
I won't charge anything. Sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy sat down and the doctor got out his
forceps. The tooth came hard but he got it. The
boy clapped his hand over his mouth but not a
sound escaped him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; said the doctor, holding out the
offending member. &ldquo;Do you want it?&rdquo; A boy's
tooth is a treasure to be exhibited to all one's
friends. He took it and put it securely in his
pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much do I have to pay?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_226" title="226"> </a>&ldquo;Did it hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy slid from the chair and out of the
door, ecstasy overspreading all the freckles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That boy has a future,&rdquo; said Mary looking
after him with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see they have brought the horse. We must
be starting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They want ye down at Pete Jansen's agin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's the matter there now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, that youngun's been <em>drinkin'</em> somethin'
agin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Into the lye this time, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it's coal oil and bluin' this time and I
don't know what else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll be down right away,&rdquo; said the doctor,
taking up his <ins title="hat.&rdquo;">hat.</ins></p>

<p>&ldquo;Get into the buggy and drive down with me,
Mary, it's just at the edge of town and then we
can drive on into the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they stopped at the house, an unpainted
little frame structure, Mary held the horse while
her husband went in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's the boy?&rdquo; he asked, looking around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's out in the back yard a-playin' now, I
guess,&rdquo; his mother replied from the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what in thunder did you send for me
for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I was scared for fear it would kill him.&rdquo;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_227" title="227"> </a>
The doctor turned to go then paused to ask,
&ldquo;How's the baby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's doin' fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's just about a week old now, isn't she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A week yesterday. Don't you want to see
how much she's growed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor went to the bed and looked down
at the wee little maiden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, so fiercely that the
woman was frightened. &ldquo;Why haven't you let
me know about this baby's <ins title="eyes.">eyes?</ins>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;W'y, we didn't think it'd 'mount to anything.
We thought they'd git well in a day or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She'll be blind in less than a week if something
isn't done for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother's been a doctorin' 'em some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there's going to be a change of doctors
right straight. I'm going to treat this baby's
eyes myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don't want any strong medicine put in
a baby's eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It don't make a bit of difference what you
want. I'm going to the drug store now to get
what I need and I want you to have warm water
and clean cloths ready by the time I get back.
Is there anyone here to do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's a piece of a girl out there in the
kitchen. She ain't much 'count.&rdquo; The doctor
went to the kitchen door and gave his orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd ruther you'd let the baby's eyes alone.
I'm afraid to have strong medicine put in 'em.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_228" title="228"> </a>For answer he went out, got into the
buggy and drove rapidly back to town where he
procured what he needed and in a few minutes
was back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd better come in this time, Mary, you'll
get tired of waiting and besides I want you to
see this baby. I want you to know something
about what every father and mother ought to
understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went in and the doctor took the baby up
and seated himself by the chair on which stood
a basin of water. The mother, with very ungracious
demeanor, looked on. Mary, shocked and
filled with pity, looked down into the baby's face.
The inflammation in the eyes was terrible. The
secretion constantly exuded and hung in great
globules to the tiny lids. Never in her life had
she seen anything like it. &ldquo;Let me hold it for
you,&rdquo; she said, sitting down and taking the baby
in her lap.</p>

<p>The doctor turned the little head toward him
and held it gently between his knees. He took
a pair of goggles from his pocket and put them
over his eyes to protect them from the poison,
then tenderly as any mother could have done,
he bathed and cleansed the poor little eyes opening
so inauspiciously upon the world. He thought
as he worked of this <ins title="terribe">terrible</ins> scourge of infancy,
producing one-third of all the blindness in the
world. He thought too, that almost all of this
blindness was preventable by prompt and proper
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_229" title="229"> </a>
treatment. Statistics had proven these two
things beyond all doubt. He thought of the
earnest physicians who had labored long to have
some laws enacted in regard to this stupendous
evil but with little result.<a name="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

2. There has been legislation for the prevention of blindness
in the States of New York, Maine, Rhode Island and
Illinois.
</p>
</div>

<p>When they were in the buggy again Mary said,
&ldquo;But what if the baby goes blind after all? Of
course they would say that you did it with your
&lsquo;strong medicine.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course they would, but that would not disturb
me in the least. But it will not go blind
now. I'll see to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon they had left the town behind them and
were fairly on their way. The soft, yet bracing,
air of the April morning was delightful. The
sun shone warm. Birds carolled everywhere.
The buds on the oak trees were swelling, while
those on the maples were bursting into red and
furzy bloom. Far off to the left a tall sycamore
held out white arms in welcome to the Springtime
and perfect stillness lay upon the landscape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so glad the long reign of winter and
bad roads is ended, John, so I can get out with
you again into the blessed country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am glad to have good company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks for that gallant little speech. Ask
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_230" title="230"> </a>
me often, but I won't go every time because you
might get tired of me and I'd be sure to get tired
of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks for that gracious little <ins title="speech.">speech.&rdquo;</ins></p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>That evening when the doctor and Mary were
sitting alone, she said, &ldquo;John, that baby's eyes
have haunted me all day long. And you say one-third
of the blindness of the world is due to this
disease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That seems to me a terrific accusation against
you doctors. What have you been doing to prevent
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything that has been done&mdash;not very
much, I'm afraid. Speaking for myself, I can
say that I have long been deeply interested. I
have written several papers on the subject&mdash;one
for our State Medical Society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far so good. But I'd like to know more
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Write to the secretary of the State Board of
Health for all the information that he can give
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day Mary wrote. Three days later
she received the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right small-caps">Springfield, Nov. 16, 1909.</p>

<p class="no-indent">My dear Mrs. Blank:</p>

<p>Several states of the Union have laws in relation
to the prevention of blindness, some good,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_231" title="231"> </a>some bad, and some indifferent, and I fear that
the last applies to the manner in which the laws
are enforced in the majority of the States. In the
December, 1908, <cite>Bulletin</cite> of this Board, a copy
of which I send you under separate cover, you
will find the Illinois law, which, as you can readily
see, is very difficult of enforcement.</p>

<p>But, as I said, much can be done in its enforcement
if the State Board of Health can secure
the co-operation of the physicians of the
State. However, in this connection you will note
that I have made an appeal to physicians, on
page&nbsp;757. Yet, to the best of my knowledge, the
Board has not received one inquiry in regard to
the enforcement of this law, except from the
Committee on the Prevention of Ophthalmia Neonatorum.</p>

<p>In regard to the other States, it will take me
some time to look up the laws, but I will advise
you in a few days.</p>

<p class="center">Sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="right small-caps">J.&nbsp;A. Egan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After reading it carefully through, Mary's
eye went back to the sentence, &ldquo;Much can be
done if the State Board of Health can secure the
co-operation of the physicians of the State.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose and walked the floor. &ldquo;If I were a
Voice&mdash;a persuasive voice,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I
would fly to the office of every physician in our
great State and then to every physician in the
land and would whisper in his ear, &lsquo;It is your
glorious privilege to give light to sightless eyes.
It is more: it is your sacred duty. O, be up and
doing!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_232" title="232"> </a>&ldquo;To think, John,&rdquo; she said, turning impetuously
toward her husband, &ldquo;that I, all these years
the wife of a man who knows this terrible truth,
should just be finding it out. Then think of the
thousands of men and women who know nothing
about it. How are they to know? Who is to
tell them? Who is to blame for the blindness in
the first place? Who can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.
Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Blank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Ardmore. Can you come up to
my house right away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he arrived at his destination he was met
at the door by a well-dressed, handsome young
man. &ldquo;Just come into this room for a few minutes,
Doctor. My wife says they are not quite
ready for you in there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the patient?&rdquo; asked the doctor as he
walked into the room indicated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The baby boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The baby boy!&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor. &ldquo;I
didn't know the little rascal had got here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you were out of town. My wife and I
thought that ended the matter but he got here
just the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mighty glad to hear it. How old is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just ten days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty fine, isn't he?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_233" title="233"> </a>&ldquo;You bet! I wouldn't take all the farms in
these United States for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure. To be sure,&rdquo; laughed the doctor.
He picked up a little volume lying open on the
table. &ldquo;Do you like Omar?&rdquo; he asked, aimlessly
turning the pages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much. I don't always get the old Persian's
meaning exactly. Take this verse,&rdquo; he
reached for the book and turning back a few
pages read:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&ldquo;The moving finger writes; and having writ,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent3">Moves on; nor all your piety nor wit<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">Shall lure it back to cancel half a line,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent3">Nor all your tears wash out a word of it.<br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">That sounds pretty but it has something in it
that almost scares a fellow&mdash;he doesn't know
why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nurse appeared in the doorway and announced
that the doctor might come in now.
Both men rose and went across the hall into the
bedroom. The doctor shook hands with the
baby's mother. &ldquo;Where did you get this?&rdquo; he
asked, laying his hand on the downy little head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came out of the everywhere into the
here,&rdquo; she quoted, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nurse, turn the baby's face up so the doctor
can see his eyes. They're greatly inflamed, Doctor,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>The doctor started. &ldquo;Bring a light closer,&rdquo; he
said sharply.</p>

<p>While the light was being brought he asked,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_234" title="234"> </a>
&ldquo;Did this inflammation begin when the baby was
about three days old?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was exactly three days old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And been growing worse ever since?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Dr. Brown was with me when he was
born. He came in the next day and everything
was all right. Then he was called to Chicago
and I didn't know enough about babies to know
that this might be serious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> ought to have known,&rdquo; said the doctor
sternly, turning to the nurse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a professional nurse. I have never
seen anything like this before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The light was brought and the nurse took the
baby in her arms. The doctor, bending over it,
lifted the swollen little lids and earnestly scrutinized
the eyes. <em>The cornea was entirely destroyed!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;O God!&rdquo; The words came near escaping
him. Sick at heart he turned his face away that
the mother might not see. She must not know
the awful truth until she was stronger. He gave
some instructions to the nurse, then left the room
followed by the baby's father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop for a few minutes, Doctor, if you please.
I'd like to ask you something about this,&rdquo; and
both resumed their seats, after Mr. Ardmore had
closed the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think the baby's eyes have been hurt
by too much light?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No by darkness&mdash;Egyptian darkness.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_235" title="235"> </a>The young man looked at him in wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the disease?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Ophthalmia Neonatorum, or infantile
sore eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the nature of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is always an infection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can that be? There has been nobody
at all in the room except Dr. Brown and the
nurse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor did not speak. There came into his
mind the image of Mary as she had asked so
earnestly, &ldquo;How are they to know? Who is to
tell them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaning slightly forward and looking the
young man in the face he said, &ldquo;I do not know
absolutely, but <em>you</em> know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether or not your child's eyes have had a
chance to be infected by certain germs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Doctor?&rdquo; asked the
young father in vague alarm.</p>

<p>Slowly, deliberately, and with keen eyes
searching the other's face the doctor made reply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that the sins of the fathers are visited
upon the children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was bewildered silence for an instant
then a wave of crimson surged over neck, cheek
and brow. It was impossible to meet the doctor's
eyes. The young man looked down and
made no attempt to speak. By and by he said in
a low voice, &ldquo;It's no use for me to deny to you,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_236" title="236"> </a>
Doctor, that I have been a fool and have let my
base passions master me. But if I had dreamed
of any such result as this they wouldn't have
mastered me&mdash;I know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man that scorns these vile things because
of the eternal wrong in them will never have
any fearful results rising up to confront him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that has been put behind me forever,
Doctor; I feel the truth and wisdom of what you
say. Just get my boy's eyes well and he shall
never be ashamed of his father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor looked away from the handsome,
intelligent face so full at that moment of love
and tenderness for this new son which had been
given into his care and keeping, and a wave of
pity surged over him. But he must go on to the
bitter end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not understood this old Persian's
verse,&rdquo; he said, taking up the little book again.
&ldquo;Tonight his meaning is to be made plain to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly he read:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&ldquo;The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent3">Moves on; nor all your Piety nor Wit<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent3">Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of <ins title="it.">it.&rdquo;</ins><br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He laid the volume gently down and turning,
faced the younger man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen: In those licentious days the Moving
Finger was writing a word for the future to reveal.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_237" title="237"> </a>
It wrote BLIND in the eyes of your helpless
child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God! You don't mean it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true. The cornea is destroyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A deathly pallor overspread the young man's
face. He bowed his head in his hands and great
sobs shook his frame. &ldquo;My God! My God!&rdquo; he
gasped over and over again. Accustomed as the
doctor was to suffering and sorrow this man's
anguish was too much for him. The tears rolled
down his cheeks and he made no effort to restrain
them.</p>

<p>After a long time the younger man raised
his head and spoke in broken words, &ldquo;Doctor, I
must not keep you here. You are needed elsewhere.
Leave me to Remorse. I am young and
you are growing old, Doctor, but will you take
this word from me? You and all in your profession
should long ago have told us these
things. The world should not lie in ignorance of
this tremendous evil. If men will not be saved
from themselves they will save their unborn
children, if they only know. God help them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor went slowly homeward, his mind
filled with the awful calamity in the household
he had left. &ldquo;It is time the world is waking,&rdquo;
he thought. &ldquo;We must arouse it.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.
Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_238" title="238"> </a>&ldquo;Is this Mrs. Blank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a manly voice vibrating with youth and
joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you that your husband has just
left a sweet little daughter at our house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, has he! I'm very glad, Mr. Farwell.
Thank you for telephoning. Father, mother and
baby all doing well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine as silk. I had to tell <em>somebody</em> right
away. Now I'm off to send some telegrams to
the folks at home. Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling. Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.
Ting-a-ling-ling-ling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mrs. Blank is it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please tell the doctor that father is
dead. He died twenty minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctor was expecting the message, Mr.
Jameson,&rdquo; said Mary gently. This, too, was the
voice of a young man, but quiet, subdued,
bringing tidings of death instead of life. And
Mary, going back to her seat in the twilight,
thought of the words of one&mdash;Life is a narrow
vale between the cold and barren peaks of two
eternities. The eternity before the baby came,
the eternity after the old man went, were solemnly
in her thoughts. But they were not cold
and barren peaks to her. They were crowned
with light and warmth and love.</p>

<p>And into her thoughts came, too, the never-ending
story of the 'phone as it was unfolding
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_239" title="239"> </a>
itself to her throughout the years. Humor and
pathos, folly and wisdom, tragedy and comedy,
pain, anguish, love, joy, sorrow&mdash;all had spoken
and had poured their brief story into the listening
ear of the helper. And when he was not
there, into the ear of one who must help in her
own poor way.</p>

<p>O countless, countless messages stored in her
memory to await his coming! Only she could
know how faithfully she had guarded and delivered
them. Only she could&mdash;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
